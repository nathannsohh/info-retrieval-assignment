And what are some of the big examples that you came up with of just how challenging this would actually be?\n\nKelly Weinersmith: It would be pretty hard. Mars might look sort of Earth-like from the photos, but it's got some really unique challenges, like its atmosphere is only 1% of the atmosphere that we have here on Earth.\n\nSo you can't go outside without a spacesuit. There'll be no enjoying the feel of the breeze on your skin. You're going to need to suit up. And that also means that if your habitat ever depressurizes and you don't fix it fast enough, you would probably not make it through that experience.\n\nWe also don't really understand how Mars impacts the human body. We've had humans orbiting Earth since the 1970s, we have had over 600 astronauts go to space, but the space stations are orbiting under the protection of Earth's magnetosphere.\n\nSo they don't get exposed to the radiation that space has to offer, which differs from what we have here on Earth. So we actually don't know, for example, how much cancer risk would be increased in a place like Mars, which doesn't have a strong magnetosphere like we have on Earth and doesn't have a thick atmosphere to protect you.\n\nThat sand on the surface of Mars, it's actually called regolith. It's sharp and jagged and sort of laden with endocrine-disrupting hormones, which will mess up your blood pressure and your heart rates. So you're going to want to make sure that you don't grow your plants directly in that or let that get into your habitat.\n\nAnd it's probably going to be cramped. Right now, it costs something like $300 to send just an apple to the International Space Station. It's going to cost way more to send it to Mars.

It really seems like something embedded in our culture -- this desire to get to the next big thing.\n\nI feel like there are a lot of people out there, including the people who have volunteered to be locked in a room at the Johnson Space Center for a year, who have dreamed about maybe going to Mars one day. Why do you think that is\n\nWeinersmith: I'm a sci-fi geek. I totally get it. The idea of waking up on the surface of Mars and seeing a Martian sunrise sounds absolutely epic. But there are people who have other specific reasons for going, and it sort of depends on the community that you're talking to.\n\nThe rotating space station community, which these days is led by Jeff Bezos, who has a rocket company called Blue Origin -- they argue that living in these rotating space stations is going to save the Earth because you can move people off-planet to these rotating space stations. That's going to reduce the pressure on the planet Earth.\n\nA lot of the Mars folks are excited about a chance to sort of start new governments and new ways of life, and a lot of them argue that Earth has become bureaucratic and wimpy and by going to Mars, we'd be able to start over again and sort of fix all the mistakes that we've made here on Earth.\n\nAnd that community tends to be led by Elon Musk, who owns SpaceX. And Musk is also particularly excited about having a backup for humanity. So the idea that if humans are multiplanetary, if something happens to the humans on Earth, there'll be a backup so humans can continue on even if something happens to Earth. So there's a lot of different reasons for wanting to go to space, a lot of different camps, but for me, I think it's mostly awesome.\n\nDetrow: So do you think there's value in these continued studies that NASA is doing? Do you think there's more information to gather about what this is like? Or like you said, is the track record pretty clear, and we know what the challenges would be?\n\nWeinersmith: You know, so I love NASA, and I love their exploration missions. And I never want to really be on the record saying that I am not pro something NASA's doing, but here I go. To me, the value of these analogs can be measured in what you change about your mission plan when the analog is done.\n\nIf at the very end they said, 'OK, we know that humans can't survive isolated and confined environments for nine months because they end up hating each other, so we're not going to go.'\n\nThat would be a concrete thing. That's not going to happen here. And as far as I can tell, there's no specific piece of information they're going to get at the end of this one year or at the end of the three one-year stints, that's going to specifically change something about a plan for going to Mars.\n\nWe've had astronauts in space for more than 50 years. Surely, we can extract the data from what we know about what astronauts eat on the International Space Station. And this just seems like an incredibly expensive way to sort of validate that. And also, it's not even running for the full two years that you would need for a mission to Mars -- because of orbital mechanics, it takes about six months to get there. You usually stay for about a year, [or that's what is suggested in] most of the proposals - and then a six-month trip back.\n\nFor two years, you're not even getting all the psychology information you'd need about how hard it is to live with four people for the whole length of time you'd need to be out there.

To provide additional context, the Magnificent Seven account for about one-quarter of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and one-half of the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) by weight.\n\nDetailed below are the median price targets set by Wall Street analysts for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWall Street sees upside in six of the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia being the only exception. But Tesla's implied upside of 25% (at the time of writing) makes it the single-best Magnificent Seven stock to buy now, according to analysts.\n\nTesla delivered 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2023, up 38% from 2022. But the company cut prices throughout the year to compensate for weak demand caused by rising interest rates. That stunted growth and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose just 3% to $25.1 billion; operating margin fell nearly 800 basis points; and non-GAAP net income dropped 39% to $2.5 billion.\n\nThe chart below provides more detail on Q4 revenue growth across the automotive, energy, and services segments.\n\nThe investment thesis for Tesla centers on its leadership in battery-electric vehicles -- not only in terms of sales, but also manufacturing technology -- and its opportunities with adjacent software and services, especially those that relate to autonomous vehicles.\n\nTesla accounted for 19.1% of battery-electric vehicle sales last year, up from 18.2% in 2022. That puts the company about 260 basis points ahead of its closest competitor, Chinese automaker BYD. There are several reasons for that success, including brand authority and its status as a first mover, but manufacturing prowess truly sets Tesla apart.\n\nThe company controls costs through factory automation and continuous innovation, such as large castings that reduce the number of parts per vehicle, which makes assembly less labor intensive. Tesla also produces battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric vehicle) at a lower cost than its peers, and that cost leadership is expected to persist through the end of the decade, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors.\n\nThose advantages were overshadowed by economic challenges that caused margins to contract last year, and the situation may not improve this year. Tesla plans to invest in its next-generation (low-cost) vehicle platform in preparation for production in 2025. But the company has earned industry-leading operating margins in the past, and it could do so again in the future.\n\nTesla will build its next-generation vehicle using a new manufacturing system that should cut production costs in half and reduce its factory footprint by 40%, according to management. That should boost margins while also enabling Tesla to build a cheaper electric car, which will extend its addressable market.\n\nWith that in mind, Grand View Research expects electric vehicle sales to grow at 15% annually through 2030.\n\nTesla has a substantial opportunity in software and services, especially where full self-driving (FSD) software is concerned. The company already sells FSD subscriptions to customers in certain geographies, but it also plans to monetize the technology through licensing deals with other automakers and robotaxi (autonomous ride-sharing) services in the future. The autonomous ride-sharing timeline is vague, but CEO Elon Musk has said robotaxi production could begin in 2024.\n\nIn any case, Tesla is well positioned to be a leader in autonomous-vehicle technology given its data advantage. Specifically, with more camera-equipped vehicles on the road, it has more driving data than its peers. That hints at FSD being superior to other autonomous-vehicle platforms because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models. Ultimately, Musk thinks FSD software and autonomous ride-sharing could push gross margins to 70%, up from 18% last year.\n\nFinally, Tesla also has monetization opportunities with Dojo, a supercomputer purpose-built for training artificial intelligence (AI) vision systems like FSD. Dojo reportedly offers sixfold better performance than graphics processing units (GPU) alternatives, meaning it should help the company achieve full autonomy more quickly. As Tesla makes progress with FSD, it may build the cachet required to sell AI cloud services to other companies.\n\nWith that in mind, Grand View Research expects the autonomous vehicle market to grow at 22% annually through 2030.\n\nWall Street expects Tesla to grow sales at 16% annually over the next five years, but that leaves room for upside if adjacent products like FSD software and autonomous ride-sharing services become significant revenue streams. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley sees that as a distinct possibility, and he believes sales could increase at 19% annually over the next seven years.\n\nIn either case, the current valuation of 6.4 times sales is reasonable, though it would be more reasonable if Jonas is correct. So, investors who think Tesla can generate meaningful revenue outside its core automotive business should consider buying a small position in the stock right now. But investors who lack confidence in that narrative should steer clear.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's the second direct attack on power supply to the factory, and there was a third attack on the railway nearby. We are very concerned,"" said plant head Andre Thierig.

Paying for food and other items with a swipe of the hand rather than with cash or credit used to be a futuristic concept from the Book of Revelation. However, some stores are already using it, including Whole Foods Market and its parent company Amazon at its Amazon Fresh stores.\n\n""The palm-recognition system works by linking a user's payment information with their unique palm print,"" explains The Exposé (United Kingdom). ""If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can also link it with your Prime account - no need to fumble in the Amazon app looking for your in-store code any longer.""\n\n""At Whole Foods, you just hover your palm over the reader once you're ready to pay and the system will find your Prime account, apply any discounts and charge the credit card you enrolled with.""\n\nWhat about facial recognition systems? At the recent G20 gathering of dystopian globalist leaders in Brazil, every attendee was forced ""to pass a biometric validation process by scanning their faces using Serpro's stand devices.""\n\nSerpro, by the way, is a Brazilian government-run data processing agency that plans to unleash facial recognition all across the land. In order to buy and sell in the near future, one will probably have to undergo a face scan, as well as pay with the swipe of the hand rather than with cash or credit.\n\n""If they can start getting this technology in place, it will inevitably be adopted by more and more institutions,"" The Exposé warns. ""And then someday you may wake up and find that you can't get a job, open a bank account or buy groceries without having your face scanned - What will you do then?""\n\nApple just released its infamous Apple Vision Pro augmented reality headset to ""augment reality"" on a continual basis, making day-to-day life more of a video game than actual reality. This will tie in well with facial recognition and palm-scanning payment systems.\n\n""Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499, is the beginning of something called 'spatial computing,' which basically boils down to running apps all around you,"" The Exposé explains.\n\n""And the company's ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world - to augment reality.""\n\nThen there is Elon Musk's new Neuralink brain implant chip, which will turn humans into transhumanist robot hybrids.

All that data has made it possible for them to streamline strategy, plan products, and create new business models that can disrupt traditional players and disadvantage new ones. Vijay Govindarajan, a top management thinker and professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, describes this pivot point as a ""shift from product as sold to product as used.""\n\n""We gave these digital giants permission to collect data on how we live, transforming strategy in the consumer sector,"" Govindarajan says. If you don't pay, after all, you're the product (although the European Union is trying to give consumers more competition and control with its Digital Markets Act that came into effect on March 7).\n\nBut much of that digital transformation has taken place in the consumer sector, where some would give up plenty of private data for the promise of a seat upgrade. What happens when Big Tech's playbook becomes possible in the industrial sector -- at the factories, farms, and other players whose business customers are often as complex as they are? That's what Govindarajan explores in Fusion Strategy, a new book with Boston University professor Venkat Venkatraman that publishes today. As the title suggests, the authors examine companies that are starting to combine their physical expertise with the kind of algorithms, AI, and interconnected data sets that have made the consumer tech giants so hard to beat.\n\nI spoke with Govindarajan about why the industrial realm has proven to be tougher terrain for many of the tech companies to conquer. ""In the first round, the digital giants won,"" he said. ""The movie studios, the camera companies didn't take them seriously.""\n\n""In the second round, it's not clear the digital giants will win. Industrial companies make physical assets where domain expertise is very important; relationships with customers are critical.""\n\nWith generative AI and machine learning, industrial players can increasingly connect with customers or partners in new ways to mine data for insights and customized recommendations. But industrial customers are not as willing to hand over that prized data as consumers looking for a bump to first class. The issues over data now being debated in Congress have long been table stakes in the corporation: privacy, transparency, trust, and compensation for the value created. More important, Govindarajan says, companies like Honeywell and Deere & Co. know how to fuse analog machinery and advanced digital technologies to create their own solutions.\n\nTo that list, let me add Collective[i], a B2B company that's quietly amassed an impressive roster of enterprise customers who leverage shared data and the company's proprietary platform to better understand buying and selling activity. The technology has taken years to build and was developed by a team of founders with their own deep expertise. CEO Tad Martin was COO of Overstock, while co-founders (and siblings) Heidi Messer and Stephen Messer created Linkshare.\n\nI spoke with Heidi Messer shortly after speaking with Govindarajan last week and was struck by the similarities in how she talks about the platform. Unlike in the consumer world, these customers don't wake up to discover someone's using their data. They know its value, and the even greater value of sharing it. That's an interesting metric to consider as we look for the next generation of digital disruptors.\n\nIn 2021, Kickstarter announced a pivot to Web3 and blockchain, only to back away in the face of fierce criticism from creators and users. We now know the reason for the crowdfunding platform's doomed pivot: a $100 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz, a potentially transformative amount of cash for the stagnating Kickstarter. But there was a catch: Andreessen wanted Kickstarter to embrace the blockchain, leading to reputational damage that the platform has yet to recover from.

There are also physical improvements, such as being able to move around the spacecraft more effectively. What isn't typically considered with artificial gravity, or the lack of gravity throughout space travel, is the impact zero gravity has on astronauts' bone density levels.\n\nAstronauts returning from tours aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were found to have shocking decreases in bone density that can lead to health problems such as frail bones that can easily shatter, and if humans want to travel to distant locations within the solar system, artificial gravity is going to have to be implemented into the spacecraft so they don't arrive at the location with weak bones, or more importantly, return back to Earth with major health problems.\n\nEnter the sci-fi concept that may actually work. Id Software founder John Carmack took to X to tell Elon Musk's SpaceX to demonstrate spin gravity with a Dragon capsule. The idea has long been discussed among the scientific community and shown in multiple sci-fi TV shows and movies. Spin gravity is the creation of inertial force that mimics the effects of gravity. This is typically achieved by rotation and is a technique commonly used by fighter pilots in training to simulate the effects of gravity on the human body.\n\nMusk responded to Carmack's X post and said that Starship, SpaceX's launch vehicle that's headed for Mars, will have a ""small spin on the way to Mars"". Adding that ""even a tiny gravity vector is better than none"".\n\nUnfortunately, this small gravity vector likely won't be enough to prevent decreasing levels of bone density for the explorers headed to Mars, but in theory spinning Starship could actually work. However, for Starship to be able to effectively simulate artificial gravity it will need to be spinning at a rate that's fast enough to generate the appropriate amount of centrifugal force. This engineering problem will take a lot of work to overcome.\n\nSpinning introduces additional problems, such as astronauts experiencing motion sickness and the possibility of spinning, resulting in ship breakage that leads Starship to spin out of control. Despite these challenges, astronauts will need to generate some form of artificial gravity aboard spacecrafts if they want to travel for months without suffering from bone density degradation.",tweaktown.com,news,TweakTown,jak_connor@tweaktown.com,Jak Connor,author,FALSE,https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/6/96781_326266_spacex-may-use-sci-fi-technique-to-create-artificial-gravity-for-its-trip-mars_full.png,null,0.1137254901960785,447929458,1

""Also, you can't just go to electric. I mean, you have a grid system in this country that's obsolete and disastrous. They can't produce the electricity. It can't distribute the electricity.""\n\n""[Joe] Biden's all-electric mandate is by very, very stupid people,"" he said EVs don't go far, referring to range anxiety. He also raised alarms about China flooding the U.S. market with low-cost EVs.\n\nCounting On Auto Workers: Trump expressed confidence in auto workers' support for him, although he doubted the loyalty of union leaders.\n\n""I don't know about that top union people because they're just riveted into Democrats,"" he said. ""They have no idea why they're like blind sheep.""\n\nHe pointed to his lead in Michigan, emphasizing his unexpected traction in traditionally Democratic territories. ""Look at my numbers in Michigan. I'm leading him [Biden] by 12 or 14 points. It's always hard for a Republican, but not now. We're leading in a lot of places that Republicans don't lead,"" he said.\n\nWhy It's Important: Biden has aligned himself closely with auto workers, a move that earned him the United Auto Workers (UAW) endorsement after he showed support during a major strike last year.\n\nBiden's administration has prioritized clean energy and electric vehicles, evidenced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The act includes provisions such as extending the EV federal tax credit and promoting EV charging infrastructure.\n\nThe Biden administration's engagement with legacy automakers over EVs has drawn criticism from Tesla's Musk, who felt sidelined from discussions.\n\nTrump's reference to Chinese competition reflects concerns about potential disruptions in the U.S. market, with worries about Chinese EV manufacturers setting up operations in Mexico to bypass duty restrictions, creating an uneven playing field for American companies.\n\nThe KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS) ended Monday's session up 1.71% at $22.66, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nImage made via photos on Shutterstock",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,,,,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB6U08A_L.jpg,null,-0.168627451,447929352,1

Ahead of the March 14th earnings call, I felt the need for a closer examination of the company's qualitative characteristics. In this article, I maintain my price target of $8 per share based on a rising P/E ratio, Getty's strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), and a forecasted demand growth in the digital licensing segment as a whole. To briefly explain the flow of this article, I first summarize the news surrounding a proposed refinancing agreement and the implications of not pursuing this option. Then, I consider historical trends in the P/E ratio to support my claim that the company is being primed for growth. Lastly, I explore two qualitative aspects of the company that I believe will later serve as the main driving forces behind this growth (namely, Getty's partnership with Nvidia and growth in the digital licensing segment).\n\nGetty Images launched a plan to refinance senior term loan facilities set to mature February 19th, 2026. The language found in Getty's 8-K filing on 02/07/2024 was rather optimistic, suggesting this would result in better loan terms and optimized interest expense. Considering that Getty Images has had an average LTD/TA ratio of 0.56 since 2022, almost three times the benchmark for technology-based companies, I was skeptical of the optimism. As stated in my previous article on Getty Images, investors need to look for active steps by management to reduce long-term debt if any positive momentum is to be expected, and this just felt like a band-aid was applied. My sentiment was solidified when S&P Global Ratings described the refinancing agreement as ""leverage neutral."" Consequently, it came as welcome news to me when Getty Images ultimately decided against the refinancing agreement in their 8-K filing on 02/15/2024. Getty pointed to below expected interest savings, which I suspected would be the case given that the federal interest rate has been trending higher and may remain stagnant during 2024.\n\nBased on fluctuations in the stock price, the news appeared to be met with a mixed reaction from investors, with price trending slightly upward from February 7th, 2024.\n\nThis news is something that I like to call a ""nothingburger."" What I mean is, Getty Images planned to enter a refinancing agreement, and then they backed out, so it's just a lot of talk with no change. What can investors take away from this? The mixed reaction of the stock price indicates to me that it is still a good time to buy Getty Images. Management is clearly looking at ways to reduce the company's debt. It simply did not work out in this case. I think it would be overly pessimistic to conclude that management will never find a tangible solution. However, if retail investors wait for news of such an agreement to be in the headlines, bigger investors will swoop in and cause the stock price to rise, resulting in missed gains. This might sound like a bit of reverse psychology, but we can see this already starting to unfold if we review some key ratios in the fundamentals.\n\nGetty Images has lackluster fundamentals compared to Shutterstock (SSTK) and Adobe (ADBE). If the average investor examined the charts below, without knowing the names of the companies, Getty Images would not be viewed as competitive as the other companies. Getty's debt-to-equity ratio has stagnated, total shareholder return has been consistently negative, but curiously enough, the PE ratio has skyrocketed.\n\nAt first glance, one might be inclined to see the above average LTD/TA ratio, listen to this talk of a foregone refinancing agreement, and conclude that rising interest expense is to blame for decreasing earnings per share, resulting in an increased PE ratio. However, one analyst firm I came across aptly points out that, ""That's how most candidates answer this question and unfortunately that's incorrect. It's an arithmetic answer that fails to account for the equivalent change in Stock Price."" Examining the debt-to-equity ratio, we actually see a decrease in early 2023, and the PE ratio doesn't increase until after this, so there must be another explanation.\n\nWhile subject to debate, and perhaps a disappointing conclusion for those wanting an objective way to calculate the price of a stock, I believe that a stock price represents nothing more than what a person is willing to pay for it. Consider a quote from Warren Buffett, ""You may have all these feelings about the stock. The stock has no feelings about you."" Warren goes on to explain that you may remember who told you about the stock, what you paid for it, etc., but the stock price does not care. Over the past 52 weeks, investors have been paid as little as $4.30 for shares of Getty. I am sure that many of those investors combed over the fundamentals, looked at the historical stock price, read news articles, and maybe even talked to friends before placing their order. At another point in the year, other investors paid as much as $4.80 per share, and likely considered many of the same metrics before placing their orders. Regardless of what price was paid, each investor likely posited that all the existing information about Getty Images was already incorporated into the stock price. As conveyed in The Intelligent Investor, assessing the validity of this claim is challenging.\n\nIt is my opinion that a stock price is governed more by psychology than fundamentals. Given the increasing PE ratio and stagnating debt-to-equity ratio, I believe we can infer that investors have placed greater consideration on the qualitative aspects of Getty Images. Therefore, we must evaluate Getty's core business and see if the company's aspirations are likely to materialize.\n\nIn a strategic move, Getty Images and Nvidia are collaborating to develop Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform aimed at providing legally compliant stock photos for small and medium businesses. This standalone version of Getty's initial AI image generator, based on Nvidia's Picasso model trained exclusively on Getty's creative and iStock's stock photo libraries, assures ""commercially safe"" image generation. Investors should take note that despite this assurance, Getty offers compensation of $10,000 per image for any unforeseen issues with Generative AI by iStock, in contrast to the unlimited compensation with Generative AI by Getty Images. The services, priced at $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each generating four images, also promise upcoming features such as inpainting and outpainting.\n\nDemand for AI-generated services is anticipated to double by 2029 (with a CAGR of 11.9%) according to market research firm Valuates. Grand View Research Firm forecasts that the AI generator market size will have an CAGR of 17.5%. Global Market Insights reported a similar CAGR of 16.5% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nIn early 2023, an article by The Verge described Getty Images and Shutterstock as being on the opposite ends of a legal debate concerning the implementation of generative AI for image development. In retrospect, I think this may have adversely affected market sentiment by portraying Getty Images as behind the times, since many believe that AI will continue to play a larger role in the future. On the contrary, I believe that Getty is taking proactive steps to safeguard its content and to secure revenue streams while embracing the future of generative AI.\n\nSimilar to Getty Images, Shutterstock has expanded its partnership with OpenAI by providing the company with access to its image database. Who has the better partnership? Getty and Shutterstock both have expansive repositories, so I feel like we would be remiss if we did not also consider how Nvidia compares to OpenAI. I think the winner is clear from a valuation standpoint. OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, whereas Nvidia just turned over $2 trillion. Not to mention that OpenAI is highly dependent on Nvidia's GPUs, as are many other competitors in this space. However, Nvidia is seldom found among top ranked generative AI companies (look at this article, for example). Based on the resources Nvidia has at its disposal, and the growing trend of generative AI, Nvidia's dominance in this space is not a matter of if, but when.\n\nInvestors should also be leery of the recent lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Personally, I find this case to be very interesting as it relates to the future of AI, but the details of the case are beyond the scope of this article (YouTuber Matthew Berman recently uploaded a video that provides an excellent 40-min summary of the lawsuit). What investors should be mindful of is that if Elon prevails against Sam Altman, Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, this will have a crippling effect on the profitability of OpenAI. In such a scenario, GPT-4 along with other forms of artificial general intelligence would become open sourced and available for the good of humanity. Unrestricted access to this type of technology would compromise the competitive edge of Shutterstock's alliance with OpenAI.\n\nTaking these things into consideration, I think Getty Images has a qualitative edge over Shutterstock through its superior partnership.\n\nIn my previous article during October 2023, the stock price for Getty Images dropped approximately 14% after a downgrade by Redburn Atlantic. At the time, concerns were raised about the future demand of online advertising. Following in November 2023, The Benchmark Company and Wedbush Securities re-iterated their previous rating of Getty Images as a 'strong buy.' Macquarie and Imperial have not issued any new guidance since August 2023. With some time away from the noise of big hedge funds, we have an opportunity to view this from a different perspective.\n\nAccording to information posted by Allied Market Research, photos as a service market are anticipated to grow at an average CAGR of 4.2% between now and 2032. In another market report published by Credence Research, they called for an average CAGR of 7% between 2023 and 2030. Custom Market Insights calculated a similar CAGR of 6%.\n\nGetty Images is operating in a sector where many are calling for growth over a long period of time. With the stock price being psychologically based, what I believe we have witnessed over the past few months is fearmongering. Some big investors think the sky is falling, and this has caused smaller investors to take their lead in an attempt to minimize losses. Minimized losses can also result in minimized gains.\n\nThe outlook presented in my thesis relies on several key assumptions that investors should consider before deciding about this stock. The more likely you think these risks are to materialize, you should invest less of your money in Getty Images.\n\nFirst, my analysis depends on competent management taking steps to eliminate and reduce the company's debt. Aside from management playing an active role in debt management, there could be external factors that prevent Getty Images from making timely payments in the future. If Getty Images were to face cash flow issues from customers who are not paying, or if there is a decrease in the demand for image licensing, then this could lead to the company's insolvency. Getty has a larger debt-to-equity ratio than its competitors, so this matter should be given extra consideration by investors.\n\nWhile the future of generative AI appears to be a promising one, I cannot be certain about the role that Getty Images or Nvidia will continue to have in this space. For now, I assess the risk of a market disruption as low, but if these two companies do not take steps to dominate the space, they are likely to fall behind to Shutterstock and OpenAI. Investors should monitor the news for continued updates about the progress of these companies in the space of generative AI.\n\nLastly, if the digital licensing sector as a whole were to go into decline, this would undoubtedly have a negative impact on Getty Images. However, this particular risk would have similar effects on Adobe and Shutterstock, with Adobe being more diversified and likely more tolerable of such an event.\n\nMy analysis of Getty Images reveals a nuanced landscape where qualitative factors play a pivotal role in shaping the investment narrative. Management's decision to abstain from a refinancing agreement, albeit initially viewed optimistically, underscores their commitment to strategic debt management. The ensuing mixed market response in the days that followed signifies an opportune entry point for investors cognizant of the ongoing efforts to alleviate the company's debt burden.\n\nDespite apparent lackluster fundamentals compared to industry counterparts, the soaring PE ratio prompts a reevaluation of the conventional metrics that govern market sentiment. Recognizing the psychological underpinnings of stock pricing is crucial for a comprehensive understanding this situation, especially in the context of Getty's qualitative aspects.\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia positions Getty Images as a frontrunner in the burgeoning Generative AI market, fostering a commercially safe environment for image generation. This, coupled with the forecasted growth in digital licensing services (as well as AI-generated services), underscores the company's potential for future profitability.\n\nThe anticipated growth in the digital licensing sector, despite short-term market noise, presents a compelling case for long-term investors. While acknowledging inherent risks, notably in debt management and market dynamics, I recommend a cautious yet optimistic positioning. Getty Images, with its strategic initiatives and qualitative focus, emerges as a strong contender in a sector poised for sustained growth. As the market navigates uncertainties, prudent investors may find value in Getty Images by considering the underlying strengths, potential market disruptions, and the evolving landscape of generative AI.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,zach_schweinsberg@seekingalpha.com,Zach Schweinsberg,author,FALSE,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458621953/image_458621953.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,null,0.4352941176470588,447928494,1

According to OpenAI's filing shared by The Verge, OpenAI Inc has asked the Court to designate the case as ""complex"" requiring ""exceptional judicial management"" as Musk's allegations are ""complicated, highly technical, and span nearly a decade"".\n\nOn February 29, Tesla CEO Musk had filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, alleging that Altman's moves -- purported to be driven by commercial interests-have led to the violation of the company's Founding Agreement for developing artificial general intelligence or AGI for the ""benefit of humanity"" and not for individual interests. Musk, in his lawsuit, has sought an order requiring OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement of making its research and technology available to the public. Read more about Musk's lawsuit here.\n\nOpenAI's stance on closed-source AGI:\n\nOne of the core arguments of Musk's complaint was that by licensing GPT-4, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has departed from OpenAI's ""original mission and historical practice"" of open-sourcing its technology. On March 5, in a statement OpenAI explained that the founding members had mutually agreed on a for-profit and closed-source model for acquiring artificial general intelligence. Disclosing specific email conversations, OpenAI argued that a closed-source AI was much safer as it would prevent someone with resources from building a copy and misusing it.\n\n'There is no Founding Agreement'\n\nAccording to Musk's lawsuit, a Founding Agreement was signed between Sam Altman, Musk, and Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI, in 2015. OpenAI has dismissed Musk's claim as fictional and has denied entering into any agreement with Musk.\n\n""The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him. The documents Musk cites as purportedly memorializing a binding contract with him -- OpenAI's certificate of incorporation and a few emails -- on their face show no promises to Musk,"" OpenAI said in its filing to a Californian Court.\n\nCalling Musk's claims as ""convoluted"" and ""incoherent"", OpenAI also pointed out that any actual agreement, which Musk believed to exist, was missing from the pleading.\n\nMusk seeks to advance his own commercial interests\n\nCountering Musk's fundamental claim that OpenAI has abandoned the Founding Agreement for using artificial intelligence technology for public benefit, OpenAI has alleged that Musk, in fact, supported a for-profit structure for the company. The filing also claimed that Musk intended to seek complete control of OpenAI, and ""dropped the project when his wishes were not followed"".\n\nOpenAI has also highlighted that Musk's plea nowhere alleges that his early donations to the company were conditioned on defendants following a specific business plan. Further, in view of OpenAI's recent technological advancements, Musk is seeking the success for himself, the filing argued.\n\nDefendants Samuel Altman and Gregory Brockman have alleged that Musk's request for ""a judicial determination that GPT-4 constitutes Artificial General Intelligence"" compels OpenAI to disclose its technology that could benefit Musk, whose ""own for-profit AI concern has not met with success in the marketplace"". In November 2023, Elon Musk-owned xAI announced the launch of Grok, an AI chatbot that would compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.\n\n""Were discovery to commence, Musk would use this suit to seek access to OpenAI's proprietary records and technology and to press for broad merits discovery. Those demands would need to be carefully policed,"" OpenAI argued.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF TECH NEWS: Our daily newsletter with the top story of the day from MediaNama, delivered to your inbox before 9 AM.

That is the question that the Macedonia of new regulations and business movements on the big social media platforms invites us to answer lately. And the answer seems to be mostly no.\n\nThe pioneer in this was the new Twitter/X by Elon Musk, who, under the banner of freedom of expression and independence, raised the price of Twitter Blue. First, with the option to reduce ads. Then, with a more expensive option of 168 euros per year, to eliminate them completely.\n\nMeta was forced to follow in his footsteps in Europe. And we say that she was forced by the siege of rulings, GDPR reviews and the implementation of the new Digital Markets Law of the European Union.\n\nIn the end, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, launched a subscription model for 9.99 euros per month only for community countries (119.88 euros per year). In exchange, he proposed not showing them ads or taking their data to carry out segmented advertising.\n\nBy the way, TikTok also did a small test with a price of $4.99 per month, just like Snapchat. That remained an attempt.\n\nExpanding the focus to the media, that have opted in recent years for subscription models, we found another case in Spain. Recently, a correction to data protection regulations meant that overnight hundreds of websites offered in their cookie banners the possibility of paying to avoid segmented advertising. The summary, for many, meant paying for privacy, and it does not seem to be proving very successful.\n\nThe large platforms have covered their backs in case these models were very successful among users. The prices for the ad-free option imposed on Meta in the EU are almost twice as expensive as what it generates for each user who sees ads. A sign that he does not want to consider that option even remotely.\n\nIn concrete numbers, Meta's ARPU (revenue per user) on its social platforms in Europe in 2023 was 64 euros on average. That is much less than the almost 120 euros it asks for per year to browse without ads.\n\nThe data of the old Twitter is difficult to know after becoming a private company in the hands of Elon Musk. For information that has been released on a recurring basis The Information They place the number of paying users at around 600,000. Of course: without separating those who pay for the basic option that limits ads to half of those who pay for the Premium+ version to eliminate them completely.\n\nFrom Hypertextual We have contacted Meta and ContentPass, a German company that manages payments for not accepting cookies on more than 400 portals in Spain, without receiving a response when we asked for figures on the number of users who have activated the ad-free options.\n\nBut how many subscribers would it take to replace Meta's revenue in the EU?\n\nThanks to Meta's detailed quarterly and annual reports, it's easy to understand both how much Meta currently earns from advertising, and how many Europeans would have to subscribe to Meta's services to replace that advertising revenue.\n\nMeta has averaged 408 million monthly users over the last 4 quarters. Each user generated an average of $63.97 per advertisement. With these rates, Meta would need just over 200 million European users paying a subscription to replace all advertising revenue.\n\nTo get an idea, we know from the new European regulation that Facebook and Instagram have just over 500 million users. Come on, what 2 out of 5 network users in Europe should pay.\n\nNeither Meta has the bills nor the users seem to be willing to pay for privacy. The other side is the advertisers. It seems that for them there is no end of a way to connect with consumers, clients and users.\n\nDespite his attempts to create the metaverse and augmented reality, Meta's business model focuses on offering targeted advertising based on its users' data. A framework that allows advertisers to reach specific market segments with astonishing precision.\n\nThis not only increases the efficiency of advertising campaigns but also improves user experience by displaying more relevant ads. Meta, in fact, estimates that each of the euros invested in its advertising system generates 3.37and has published statements on its advertiser panels about the new limitations.\n\nHowever, its model has taken serious hits. The growing concern about privacy (or perhaps not so much) and the implementation of stricter regulations; such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and Apple's privacy updates on iOS, have impacted the way companies like Meta collect and use user information for targeted advertising.\n\nMeta reinforced this in its statement announcing these measures a few months ago:\n\nWe believe in an Internet supported by advertising and that gives people access to personalized products and services, regardless of their economic situation. It also allows small businesses to reach potential customers, grow their businesses and create new markets, driving the growth of the European economy. And like other companies, we will continue to advocate for an ad-supported Internet, including with our new subscription offering in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. But we respect the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations and are committed to complying with them.\n\nWe will continue to invest to create new tools that preserve the value that both people and businesses gain from personalized advertising, while allowing users to control their advertising experience on our platforms.\n\nThere are many who have tried to create a social network without ads in vain. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tried it without much success with WT Social.\n\nWith a little longer duration, but also already closed, we find Ello. Launched in 2014, it was promoted as an ad-free space, focused on user privacy and a more authentic, high-quality experience in online social interactions. Ello presented itself as an ""anti-Facebook"" social network. At a time when concerns about data privacy and the ubiquity of advertising on social media were growing among users.\n\nIts business model was based on the idea of not selling user data to advertisers or third parties, and it promised not to show ads within its platform. Instead, This was intended to generate income through a freemium strategy. In it, users could pay for additional features and special services.\n\nEl's design was minimalist and focused on visual content. That attracted a community of artists, designers and creatives in its early days. The platform offered a simple user experience and elegant aesthetic, setting it apart from other more saturated and commercialized social networks.\n\nDespite its promising launch and initial media attention, It ended up closing less than a year ago.. One of the main problems was the difficulty in maintaining and scaling its user base. Although there was an initial spike of interest and a large number of registrations in the first few months, many users found the platform less attractive once the novelty wore off.\n\nFor all this, it seems that the internet advertising model has a lifespan for a whilealthough it will be transformed with the change that the cookie model means in the coming months.",bullfrag.com,news,Bullfrag,,,,,https://i0.wp.com/imgs.hipertextual.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/zuckerberg_and_elon_musk_doing_money_with_social-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&quality=55&strip=all&ssl=1,null,-0.019607843,447927563,4

Ahead of the March 14th earnings call, I felt the need for a closer examination of the company's qualitative characteristics. In this article, I maintain my price target of $8 per share based on a rising P/E ratio, Getty's strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), and a forecasted demand growth in the digital licensing segment as a whole. To briefly explain the flow of this article, I first summarize the news surrounding a proposed refinancing agreement and the implications of not pursuing this option. Then, I consider historical trends in the P/E ratio to support my claim that the company is being primed for growth. Lastly, I explore two qualitative aspects of the company that I believe will later serve as the main driving forces behind this growth (namely, Getty's partnership with Nvidia and growth in the digital licensing segment).\n\nGetty Images launched a plan to refinance senior term loan facilities set to mature February 19th, 2026. The language found in Getty's 8-K filing on 02/07/2024 was rather optimistic, suggesting this would result in better loan terms and optimized interest expense. Considering that Getty Images has had an average LTD/TA ratio of 0.56 since 2022, almost three times the benchmark for technology-based companies, I was skeptical of the optimism. As stated in my previous article on Getty Images, investors need to look for active steps by management to reduce long-term debt if any positive momentum is to be expected, and this just felt like a band-aid was applied. My sentiment was solidified when S&P Global Ratings described the refinancing agreement as ""leverage neutral."" Consequently, it came as welcome news to me when Getty Images ultimately decided against the refinancing agreement in their 8-K filing on 02/15/2024. Getty pointed to below expected interest savings, which I suspected would be the case given that the federal interest rate has been trending higher and may remain stagnant during 2024.\n\nBased on fluctuations in the stock price, the news appeared to be met with a mixed reaction from investors, with price trending slightly upward from February 7th, 2024.\n\nThis news is something that I like to call a ""nothingburger."" What I mean is, Getty Images planned to enter a refinancing agreement, and then they backed out, so it's just a lot of talk with no change. What can investors take away from this? The mixed reaction of the stock price indicates to me that it is still a good time to buy Getty Images. Management is clearly looking at ways to reduce the company's debt. It simply did not work out in this case. I think it would be overly pessimistic to conclude that management will never find a tangible solution. However, if retail investors wait for news of such an agreement to be in the headlines, bigger investors will swoop in and cause the stock price to rise, resulting in missed gains. This might sound like a bit of reverse psychology, but we can see this already starting to unfold if we review some key ratios in the fundamentals.\n\nGetty Images has lackluster fundamentals compared to Shutterstock (SSTK) and Adobe (ADBE). If the average investor examined the charts below, without knowing the names of the companies, Getty Images would not be viewed as competitive as the other companies. Getty's debt-to-equity ratio has stagnated, total shareholder return has been consistently negative, but curiously enough, the PE ratio has skyrocketed.\n\nAt first glance, one might be inclined to see the above average LTD/TA ratio, listen to this talk of a foregone refinancing agreement, and conclude that rising interest expense is to blame for decreasing earnings per share, resulting in an increased PE ratio. However, one analyst firm I came across aptly points out that, ""That's how most candidates answer this question and unfortunately that's incorrect. It's an arithmetic answer that fails to account for the equivalent change in Stock Price."" Examining the debt-to-equity ratio, we actually see a decrease in early 2023, and the PE ratio doesn't increase until after this, so there must be another explanation.\n\nWhile subject to debate, and perhaps a disappointing conclusion for those wanting an objective way to calculate the price of a stock, I believe that a stock price represents nothing more than what a person is willing to pay for it. Consider a quote from Warren Buffett, ""You may have all these feelings about the stock. The stock has no feelings about you."" Warren goes on to explain that you may remember who told you about the stock, what you paid for it, etc., but the stock price does not care. Over the past 52 weeks, investors have been paid as little as $4.30 for shares of Getty. I am sure that many of those investors combed over the fundamentals, looked at the historical stock price, read news articles, and maybe even talked to friends before placing their order. At another point in the year, other investors paid as much as $4.80 per share, and likely considered many of the same metrics before placing their orders. Regardless of what price was paid, each investor likely posited that all the existing information about Getty Images was already incorporated into the stock price. As conveyed in The Intelligent Investor, assessing the validity of this claim is challenging.\n\nIt is my opinion that a stock price is governed more by psychology than fundamentals. Given the increasing PE ratio and stagnating debt-to-equity ratio, I believe we can infer that investors have placed greater consideration on the qualitative aspects of Getty Images. Therefore, we must evaluate Getty's core business and see if the company's aspirations are likely to materialize.\n\nIn a strategic move, Getty Images and Nvidia are collaborating to develop Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform aimed at providing legally compliant stock photos for small and medium businesses. This standalone version of Getty's initial AI image generator, based on Nvidia's Picasso model trained exclusively on Getty's creative and iStock's stock photo libraries, assures ""commercially safe"" image generation. Investors should take note that despite this assurance, Getty offers compensation of $10,000 per image for any unforeseen issues with Generative AI by iStock, in contrast to the unlimited compensation with Generative AI by Getty Images. The services, priced at $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each generating four images, also promise upcoming features such as inpainting and outpainting.\n\nDemand for AI-generated services is anticipated to double by 2029 (with a CAGR of 11.9%) according to market research firm Valuates. Grand View Research Firm forecasts that the AI generator market size will have an CAGR of 17.5%. Global Market Insights reported a similar CAGR of 16.5% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nIn early 2023, an article by The Verge described Getty Images and Shutterstock as being on the opposite ends of a legal debate concerning the implementation of generative AI for image development. In retrospect, I think this may have adversely affected market sentiment by portraying Getty Images as behind the times, since many believe that AI will continue to play a larger role in the future. On the contrary, I believe that Getty is taking proactive steps to safeguard its content and to secure revenue streams while embracing the future of generative AI.\n\nSimilar to Getty Images, Shutterstock has expanded its partnership with OpenAI by providing the company with access to its image database. Who has the better partnership? Getty and Shutterstock both have expansive repositories, so I feel like we would be remiss if we did not also consider how Nvidia compares to OpenAI. I think the winner is clear from a valuation standpoint. OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, whereas Nvidia just turned over $2 trillion. Not to mention that OpenAI is highly dependent on Nvidia's GPUs, as are many other competitors in this space. However, Nvidia is seldom found among top ranked generative AI companies (look at this article, for example). Based on the resources Nvidia has at its disposal, and the growing trend of generative AI, Nvidia's dominance in this space is not a matter of if, but when.\n\nInvestors should also be leery of the recent lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Personally, I find this case to be very interesting as it relates to the future of AI, but the details of the case are beyond the scope of this article (YouTuber Matthew Berman recently uploaded a video that provides an excellent 40-min summary of the lawsuit). What investors should be mindful of is that if Elon prevails against Sam Altman, Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, this will have a crippling effect on the profitability of OpenAI. In such a scenario, GPT-4 along with other forms of artificial general intelligence would become open sourced and available for the good of humanity. Unrestricted access to this type of technology would compromise the competitive edge of Shutterstock's alliance with OpenAI.\n\nTaking these things into consideration, I think Getty Images has a qualitative edge over Shutterstock through its superior partnership.\n\nIn my previous article during October 2023, the stock price for Getty Images dropped approximately 14% after a downgrade by Redburn Atlantic. At the time, concerns were raised about the future demand of online advertising. Following in November 2023, The Benchmark Company and Wedbush Securities re-iterated their previous rating of Getty Images as a 'strong buy.' Macquarie and Imperial have not issued any new guidance since August 2023. With some time away from the noise of big hedge funds, we have an opportunity to view this from a different perspective.\n\nAccording to information posted by Allied Market Research, photos as a service market are anticipated to grow at an average CAGR of 4.2% between now and 2032. In another market report published by Credence Research, they called for an average CAGR of 7% between 2023 and 2030. Custom Market Insights calculated a similar CAGR of 6%.\n\nGetty Images is operating in a sector where many are calling for growth over a long period of time. With the stock price being psychologically based, what I believe we have witnessed over the past few months is fearmongering. Some big investors think the sky is falling, and this has caused smaller investors to take their lead in an attempt to minimize losses. Minimized losses can also result in minimized gains.\n\nThe outlook presented in my thesis relies on several key assumptions that investors should consider before deciding about this stock. The more likely you think these risks are to materialize, you should invest less of your money in Getty Images.\n\nFirst, my analysis depends on competent management taking steps to eliminate and reduce the company's debt. Aside from management playing an active role in debt management, there could be external factors that prevent Getty Images from making timely payments in the future. If Getty Images were to face cash flow issues from customers who are not paying, or if there is a decrease in the demand for image licensing, then this could lead to the company's insolvency. Getty has a larger debt-to-equity ratio than its competitors, so this matter should be given extra consideration by investors.\n\nWhile the future of generative AI appears to be a promising one, I cannot be certain about the role that Getty Images or Nvidia will continue to have in this space. For now, I assess the risk of a market disruption as low, but if these two companies do not take steps to dominate the space, they are likely to fall behind to Shutterstock and OpenAI. Investors should monitor the news for continued updates about the progress of these companies in the space of generative AI.\n\nLastly, if the digital licensing sector as a whole were to go into decline, this would undoubtedly have a negative impact on Getty Images. However, this particular risk would have similar effects on Adobe and Shutterstock, with Adobe being more diversified and likely more tolerable of such an event.\n\nMy analysis of Getty Images reveals a nuanced landscape where qualitative factors play a pivotal role in shaping the investment narrative. Management's decision to abstain from a refinancing agreement, albeit initially viewed optimistically, underscores their commitment to strategic debt management. The ensuing mixed market response in the days that followed signifies an opportune entry point for investors cognizant of the ongoing efforts to alleviate the company's debt burden.\n\nDespite apparent lackluster fundamentals compared to industry counterparts, the soaring PE ratio prompts a reevaluation of the conventional metrics that govern market sentiment. Recognizing the psychological underpinnings of stock pricing is crucial for a comprehensive understanding this situation, especially in the context of Getty's qualitative aspects.\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia positions Getty Images as a frontrunner in the burgeoning Generative AI market, fostering a commercially safe environment for image generation. This, coupled with the forecasted growth in digital licensing services (as well as AI-generated services), underscores the company's potential for future profitability.\n\nThe anticipated growth in the digital licensing sector, despite short-term market noise, presents a compelling case for long-term investors. While acknowledging inherent risks, notably in debt management and market dynamics, I recommend a cautious yet optimistic positioning. Getty Images, with its strategic initiatives and qualitative focus, emerges as a strong contender in a sector poised for sustained growth. As the market navigates uncertainties, prudent investors may find value in Getty Images by considering the underlying strengths, potential market disruptions, and the evolving landscape of generative AI.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,kathy_d_woodward@todayheadline.co,Kathy D.

These scams, related to Bitcoin, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, and other cryptocurrencies, resulted in over 57,000 victims falling prey to these schemes.\n\nWhat Happened: The majority of victims were drawn to phishing websites through comments made by impersonator accounts on X, reported Coin Telegraph on Tuesday, citing a report by Scam Sniffer.\n\nThe report also highlighted that the Ethereum mainnet accounted for 78% of the total thefts, with ERC-20 tokens being the primary assets stolen, making up 86% of all assets stolen.\n\nMost of the Ethereum token thefts were due to users signing phishing signatures and transaction approvals, such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance, and Uniswap Permit2. The report also noted that most wallet drainers have now started using account abstraction wallets as token approval spenders, enabling more functionality and smart contract compatibility for Ethereum wallets.\n\nDespite a higher number of phishing victims compared to January, February saw a reduction in the total amount stolen. The month also witnessed a significant drop in the number of victims who lost over $1 million.\n\nScammers often target social media accounts of high-profile figures, sometimes replying to posts with a fake account designed to mimic the genuine one or even hacking an account to post phishing links. In February, MicroStrategy's X account was hacked, leading to around $440,000 in crypto being stolen.

Ethereum users were particularly targeted, with the majority of the losses involving ether and ERC20 tokens.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2023, the U.S. witnessed a staggering 53% increase in losses from cryptocurrency investment scams, reaching a total of $3.94 billion. The report also highlighted that the overall investment frauds saw a 38% increase, reaching $4.57 billion from $3.31 billion. The majority of these frauds were cryptocurrency scams, emphasizing the significant role that digital currency has in online crime.\n\nEarlier in January, an investigation into copyright violations by the German state of Saxony led to the uncovering of 50,000 Bitcoin BTC/USD acquired using the proceeds of pirated works.

Hughes Communications India (HCIPL) and OneWeb have signed a six-year distribution partner agreement to provide Low Earth orbit (LEO) connectivity services across India.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, HCIPL, President and Managing Director, Shivaji Chatterjee said OneWeb will have an early-mover advantage in India, as competitors who are in fray to provide satellite communications service in India are either in the development stage or lag behind in data link speed. OneWeb has submitted an application to the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC) of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for spectrum allocation. Once Spectrum is allocated, OneWeb can launch the commercial services, Chatterjee said.\n\n""OneWeb having received the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) authorisation is well within its rights to apply to WPC for spectrum allocation, as a VSAT Service provider. Considering both the factors, I hope OneWeb should get the spectrum allocated fast in order to be able to start the commercial service in the first half of 2024,"" Chatterjee added. He said OneWeb will have a significant impact in the mobility space -- aero, maritime and land mobility, cellular backhaul for 4G, defense, off-shore rigs, remote bank and enterprise branches.\n\nSunil Bharti-owned Bharti Group holds majority stake in OneWeb and HCIPL is a joint venture between Bharti Group and satellite services company Hughes. Chatterjee said OneWeb is ideally placed to cater to the requirements of scantily populated villages where it can provide a 50-200 megabit per second backhaul which then can be further distributed to different consumers in that village -- homes, consumer devices, schools, health centres etc.\n\nHe said OneWeb has no plans to provide a direct-to-mobile kind of service like Elon Musk-owned Starlink, as the technology is not yet developed and mature. Starlink is working on technology to provide satellite services directly on smartphones. On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone. Starlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.Chatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.""As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,"" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.""We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,"" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.He said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n""Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,"" Chatterjee said. He said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n""For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship. In the Indian context, it will be interesting to see the use cases for MEO,"" Chatterjee said. He said that the other big LEO entrant, Amazon Kuiper is making progress ""but is still 2-3 years away from global commercial service."" ""They launched a couple of test satellites a few months back which seem to be doing well. Amazon Kuiper appears to have a big interest in the B2C play too like Starlink '? and will be different from OneWeb in that sense which is focused on Business-to-business (B2B) services,"" Chatterjee said.

Fans Feel for 81-year-old Martin Scorsese, Here's Why - News18","Did you know Billie Eilish has two Oscars to her name while Martin Scorsese has 'just' one? Internet can't let that sink in.\n\nBillie Eilish's heartfelt song ""What Was I Made For?"" clinched the coveted title of Best Original Song, ensuring that ""Barbie"" wouldn't leave the ceremony empty-handed. The soundtrack for Greta Gerwig's blockbuster not only became a sensation but also a powerhouse in its own right, boasting tracks from top-tier artists. Co-written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, ""What Was I Made For?"" had already snagged the Song of the Year at the Grammys, making it a hot favorite for the Oscars. This marks the dynamic duo's second Oscar win for Original Song, following their victory with ""No Time to Die"" from the 2021 James Bond extravaganza.\n\nAt just 22, Eilish now stands as the youngest two-time Oscar winner in history, a feat as remarkable as her talent, and perhaps a testament to a sprinkle of luck, something Martin Scorsese, at 81, knows all too well.\n\nAlso Read: 'Inception' to Oscars: Man's Ode to Christopher Nolan is 'Plot Twist' No One Saw Coming\n\nThe list of revered directors who never grasped the coveted Directing Oscar -- Kubrick, Hitchcock, Godard, Welles, and more -- seems to render the accolade somewhat arbitrary. Yet, Martin Scorsese, despite his unmatched contributions to cinema, openly harbours a desire for more Oscar gold. While his lone victory for ""The Departed"" stands as a testament to his prowess, his esteemed editor Thelma Schoonmaker insists he's been snubbed at least seven times. With 11 nominations to his name and recent works amassing numerous nods sans wins, the disparity is glaring, to say the least.\n\nAs one 'X' user rightly put it, ""Martin Scorsese: one Oscar, Billie Eilish: two Oscars...That's the Academy of Hollywood.""\n\nScorsese's career brims with masterpieces, some arguably eclipsing ""The Departed."" His magnum opus ""Raging Bull"" lost out to ""Ordinary People,"" a perennial source of bewilderment. Similarly, ""Goodfellas"" fell to Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves,"" and the oversight of ""Taxi Driver"" remains a glaring omission.\n\nAdding to that, Scorsese's direction in ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" though not without its flaws, was a masterclass in filmmaking. Despite stiff competition, particularly from Christopher Nolan, Scorsese's skill was undeniable, yet the Oscar remained out of reach. While some hope for better luck with his next project, the Academy's track record suggests that Scorsese's contributions may continue to be undervalued -- a sentiment echoed by many online.\n\nNonetheless, as the younger Eilish graciously accepted her Oscar, expressing gratitude for the song and the film's impact, one couldn't help but reflect on Scorsese's unfulfilled journey with the Academy. His legacy is a testament to cinematic excellence, a narrative sometimes overshadowed by the glamour of awards season.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Says Oscars is a 'Woke Contest', Internet Feels 'He is Just Jealous'\n\nYet, as the internet celebrated Eilish's win, the bittersweet realisation remained: she had her moment, but Scorsese's awaits. And as Eilish humbly acknowledged those affected by the movie, one could only wonder when the Academy might finally recognize the genius of a cinematic titan like Scorsese.",news18.com,news,News18,,,,,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/03/untitled-2024-03-12t123207.069-2024-03-77d50d9cf02432bf198c6c1c27fc0385-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675,null,0.3803921568627451,447924560,1

The company has called Musk's case frivolous and stated that Musk himself supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI.\n\n""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the document read. ""So he brings this action accusing Defendants of breaching a contract that never existed and duties Musk was never owed, demanding relief calculated to benefit a competitor to OpenAI.""\n\nWhy It Matters: Following Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla characterized the legal action as a ""salve on a bruised ego,"" suggesting that Musk's decision to sue was driven by his ego rather than any legitimate grievance.\n\nEarlier, it was also revealed that Musk had once suggested that OpenAI's only path to compete with Alphabet Inc.'s Google was through a merger with Tesla. However, his proposal wasn't met with much enthusiasm and he left the ChatGPT-parent in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has announced that his AI venture, xAI, will open-source the code of its AI chatbot Grok, this week, while also throwing shade at OpenAI by calling the company itself a ""lie.""\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: OpenAI, Closed Source?

Former president Trump, who previously ordered a ban on TikTok due to national security concerns, now opposes the ban.\n\nA TikTok ban is on the cards in the United States (US). But surprisingly, Donald Trump, who as US president had passed an executive order banning the popular Chinese video-sharing app, now stands against it.\n\nIn 2020, then-president Trump ordered a ban on new downloads of the TikTok app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, citing national security concerns.\n\nA proposal was even made for US companies to own a US entity of TikTok for managing domestic user data and content moderation. However, legal challenges and Trump's impending departure from office prevented the ban and US industry involvement from happening.\n\nPresident Biden revoked the Trump-era bans on TikTok and WeChat in mid-2021 through an executive order months after taking office.\n\nUS lawmakers are now making moves to ban TikTok once again.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a rare unanimous vote of 50-0, recently approved bipartisan legislation requiring ByteDance to divest its ownership of the app within 165 days or be expelled from app stores and web-hosting services. The bill was unveiled alongside the China Select Committee.\n\nThe ""Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act"" imposes similar restrictions on any app that is purportedly controlled by US' foreign adversaries, including China, Iran, Russia, or North Korea. It establishes a process for President Biden, or any subsequent president, to designate apps that should be prohibited under the law.\n\nThe House Majority Leader announced plans to bring the ""critical national security bill"" to the House floor for a vote early this week. Two-thirds of the members will have to vote in favour of the bill for it to win approval. The White House has indicated President Biden would sign the bill.\n\nThis movement should have ideally pleased Trump and the conservatives who swear by him. But that was not to be.\n\nTaking to his social media platform Truth Social, the former US president : ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!""\n\nIn saying so, Trump seems to have made his choice for who he considers the greater evil between TikTok and Facebook, and it's not the one with the Chinese parent company and a large American user base of 1,700 lakh.\n\nOnly about four years ago, the former president had said TikTok's data collection posed a threat by potentially allowing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.\n\nHe expressed concerns that this access could enable China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, compile dossiers of personal information for blackmail purposes, and engage in corporate espionage.\n\nThese concerns about TikTok have now supposedly taken a backseat in comparison to who he believes are ""a true Enemy of the People.""\n\nTrump has been a critic of Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after two of his posts were removed during the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023.\n\nInterestingly, while Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok last month, Trump's has not.\n\nBiotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran for president before suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump, threw his weight in support of the former president's opposition to a TikTok ban. He put out a in which he said the legislation ""doesn't make any sense.""\n\nRamaswamy said concerns surrounding TikTok, such as addiction among kids and possible sharing of US user data with the CCP, need to be tackled but aren't specific to TikTok.\n\n""It isn't limited to just TikTok or even Chinese-owned companies in the US. It expands to include even so-called US companies that are still beholden to the CCP because they do business in China,"" he said.\n\nAs an example, he cited reporting from a ""couple of years ago"" in the Wall Street Journal that showed Airbnb was ""providing US user data to the CCP as a condition for doing business.""\n\n""Ban US companies from providing US user data to China... But it's beyond silly to pick just one random company and go after them because that is temporarily a politically popular thing to do, while actually failing to solve the actual problem that applies to Chinese companies and US companies alike, including the US companies that do business in China,"" Ramaswamy said in the video.\n\nIn contrast, the former US presidential candidate was "" to banning TikTok outright"" in February 2023.\n\nKellyanne Conway, the former senior aide to President Trump, is also said to be advocating for TikTok in Congress, for which she is being compensated by the conservative Club for Growth. She has reportedly had multiple meetings with lawmakers in recent months regarding the app, according to a in Politico.\n\nBillionaire investor Jeff Yass, a donor to the Club for Growth, holds a 15 per cent stake in ByteDance. Club for Growth leaders have strongly opposed efforts to ban TikTok.

The decline of international institutions like the UN, falling usage of the dollar as a global currency, human displacement due to climate change and influence of global tech companies will define the new world order in this century,"" said Dr Ram Madhav, President of the India Foundation on the occasion of 'Capital Talks, A Thought Leadership Series', which began with the lecture titled India & The World - A Perspective from Bharat, organised by the Jindal India Institute of O.P. Jindal Global University.\n\n""Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.""\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as ""widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book ""Partitioned Freedom"" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,"" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. ""An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,"" Dr Madhav said.\n\n""We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared. At the same time, there is the decreasing influence of the American dollar and dollar-based trading which has come down to 58%. So we are entering into a multi-currency system today. And lastly, very interestingly, there is a return of nationalism and strong national identities in different parts of the world. It's a very geopolitical reality.""\n\nThe inaugural Capital Talks Lecture concluded with a detailed discussion and interaction with Dr Ram Madhav, involving Dr Sreeram Chaulia, Director General of the Jindal India Institute; Dr Mohan Kumar, Professor & Dean of the Office of International Affairs & Global Initiatives, and Ms. Ambreen Khan, Adjunct Professor of Practice & Director Media Outreach and Special Initiatives, O.P. Jindal Global University. The discussion and audience interaction covered subjects like developing a discourse on positive nationalism, the need for economic stability, investing in the Indian economy for a double digit GDP growth, and the strength of culture and India as a civilisational state.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by OP Jindal University.

""We are able to look at insurance claims data. We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged. Tesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology. ""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans. ""Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.""\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings. ""We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,"" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise ""is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,"" not as a safety feature. Different assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz , BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n""This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,"" Mercedes said in a statement. ""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously."" Automakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said. ""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

Hughes Communications India (HCIPL) and OneWeb have signed a six-year distribution partner agreement to provide Low Earth orbit (LEO) connectivity services across India.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, HCIPL, President and Managing Director, Shivaji Chatterjee said OneWeb will have an early-mover advantage in India, as competitors who are in fray to provide satellite communications service in India are either in the development stage or lag behind in data link speed.\n\nOneWeb has submitted an application to the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC) of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for spectrum allocation. Once Spectrum is allocated, OneWeb can launch the commercial services, Chatterjee said.\n\n""OneWeb having received the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) authorisation is well within its rights to apply to WPC for spectrum allocation, as a VSAT Service provider. Considering both the factors, I hope OneWeb should get the spectrum allocated fast in order to be able to start the commercial service in the first half of 2024,"" Chatterjee added.\n\nHe said OneWeb will have a significant impact in the mobility space -- aero, maritime and land mobility, cellular backhaul for 4G, defense, off-shore rigs, remote bank and enterprise branches.\n\nSunil Bharti-owned Bharti Group holds majority stake in OneWeb and HCIPL is a joint venture between Bharti Group and satellite services company Hughes.\n\nChatterjee said OneWeb is ideally placed to cater to the requirements of scantily populated villages where it can provide a 50-200 megabit per second backhaul which then can be further distributed to different consumers in that village -- homes, consumer devices, schools, health centres etc.\n\nHe said OneWeb has no plans to provide a direct-to-mobile kind of service like Elon Musk-owned Starlink, as the technology is not yet developed and mature.\n\nStarlink is working on technology to provide satellite services directly on smartphones. On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone.\n\nStarlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.\n\nChatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.\n\n""As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,"" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.\n\n""We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,"" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.\n\nHe said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n""Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n""For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship. In the Indian context, it will be interesting to see the use cases for MEO,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the other big LEO entrant, Amazon Kuiper is making progress ""but is still 2-3 years away from global commercial service.""\n\n""They launched a couple of test satellites a few months back which seem to be doing well. Amazon Kuiper appears to have a big interest in the B2C play too like Starlink ' and will be different from OneWeb in that sense which is focused on Business-to-business (B2B) services,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nEmail query sent to Jio and Amazon on Chatterjee's comment did not elicit any reply.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,,,,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108425858,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-16380,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",null,0.2078431372549019,447922472,1

Musk was one of the co-founders of the AI non-profit, which commenced on December 11, 2015. Citing a conflict of interest with his upcoming venture at Neuralink, Musk exited the OpenAI board in 2018. With ChatGPT's phenomenal success, Musk went on a tirade dissing OpenAI's novel AI chatbot, deeming it harmful. While he announced (and later launched) Grok AI by his AI company xAI, ChatGPT's rival, Musk slammed his former startup for collaborating with Microsoft and turning for-profit. Sam Altman's venture further drew criticism for not open-sourcing its LLMs, drawing the moniker 'ClosedAI' from Elon Musk and others.\n\nTaking another swing at OpenAI, Musk has now announced that he will open source Grok AI within this week. Grok would join the league of other open source AIs, including Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta and French firm Minstral AI. Google's AI model, Gemma, too, allows developers to customize it. In his Twitter tirade, while announcing Grok going open source, Musk again accused that 'OpenAI is a lie.'\n\nAs OpenAI unveiled text-to-video AI model Sora, Musk filed a lawsuit against the company for going astray of its purpose and abandoning its mission of staying non-profit for the benefit of humanity. Reacting to an OpenAI statement concerning the same, Elon Musk remarked that he would drop the lawsuit if OpenAI changed their name to ClosedAI.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Claims Tesla's AI Render Better Physics Than OpenAI's Sora; Plans Of Releasing Video Games Too\n\nSee Also: OpenAI Shares Elon Musk's Emails, Says He Wanted 'Full Control' Of The Company\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Suggests Directors Who Could Stand Up To Sam Altman Amid Rumors Of OpenAI Achieving AGI",in.mashable.com,news,Mashable India,,,,,https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/6/69684/69684_4rvx.jpg,eng-9383543,0.043137255,447922337,14

Jindal Global University.\n\n""Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.""\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as ""widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book ""Partitioned Freedom"" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,"" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. ""An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,"" Dr Madhav said.\n\n""We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared. At the same time, there is the decreasing influence of the American dollar and dollar-based trading which has come down to 58%. So we are entering into a multi-currency system today. And lastly, very interestingly, there is a return of nationalism and strong national identities in different parts of the world. It's a very geopolitical reality.""\n\nThe inaugural Capital Talks Lecture concluded with a detailed discussion and interaction with Dr Ram Madhav, involving Dr Sreeram Chaulia, Director General of the Jindal India Institute; Dr Mohan Kumar, Professor & Dean of the Office of International Affairs & Global Initiatives, and Ms. Ambreen Khan, Adjunct Professor of Practice & Director Media Outreach and Special Initiatives, O.P. Jindal Global University. The discussion and audience interaction covered subjects like developing a discourse on positive nationalism, the need for economic stability, investing in the Indian economy for a double digit GDP growth, and the strength of culture and India as a civilisational state.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by OP Jindal University.

As the complaint makes apparent, the business claimed that there is no ""Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk.""\n\nThe purported Founding Agreement is a fabrication crafted by Musk to unfairly lay claim to the successes of a venture he initially contributed to, subsequently disengaged from, and witnessed thrive in his absence.\n\nIn response to Musk's complaint last week, OpenAI said, ""Musk wanted us to merge with Tesla, or he wanted full control"" as the business considered a for-profit structure to achieve the objective.\n\nOpenAI claimed in a blog post that Musk wanted ""majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO.""\n\n""He withheld funding"" during these talks. According to Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI has become ""a closed-source de facto subsidiary"" of Microsoft.\n\nMusk, the owner of X, announced the release of Grok, which was developed with xAI technology, with an agreement for unrestricted code testing.

Once Spectrum is allocated, OneWeb can launch the commercial services, Chatterjee said.\n\n""OneWeb having received the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) authorisation is well within its rights to apply to WPC for spectrum allocation, as a VSAT Service provider. Considering both the factors, I hope OneWeb should get the spectrum allocated fast in order to be able to start the commercial service in the first half of 2024,"" Chatterjee added.\n\nHe said OneWeb will have a significant impact in the mobility space -- aero, maritime and land mobility, cellular backhaul for 4G, defense, off-shore rigs, remote bank and enterprise branches.\n\nSunil Bharti-owned Bharti Group holds majority stake in OneWeb and HCIPL is a joint venture between Bharti Group and satellite services company Hughes.\n\nChatterjee said OneWeb is ideally placed to cater to the requirements of scantily populated villages where it can provide a 50-200 megabit per second backhaul which then can be further distributed to different consumers in that village -- homes, consumer devices, schools, health centres etc.\n\nHe said OneWeb has no plans to provide a direct-to-mobile kind of service like Elon Musk-owned Starlink, as the technology is not yet developed and mature.\n\nStarlink is working on technology to provide satellite services directly on smartphones. On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone.\n\nStarlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.\n\nChatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.\n\n""As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,"" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.\n\n""We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,"" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.\n\nHe said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n""Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n""For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship. In the Indian context, it will be interesting to see the use cases for MEO,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the other big LEO entrant, Amazon Kuiper is making progress ""but is still 2-3 years away from global commercial service."" ""They launched a couple of test satellites a few months back which seem to be doing well. Amazon Kuiper appears to have a big interest in the B2C play too like Starlink '"" and will be different from OneWeb in that sense which is focused on Business-to-business (B2B) services,"" Chatterjee said.\n\nEmail query sent to Jio and Amazon on Chatterjee's comment did not elicit any reply.

Last year, Musk introduced Grok, aiming to rival OpenAI -- a firm he co-founded with CEO Sam Altman in 2015, providing essential initial funding. Despite leaving OpenAI a few years after its inception, Musk recently initiated a lawsuit against the organization, accusing it of deviating from its founding non-profit principles of widely sharing AI research.\n\nIn a move that thrusts him into the heart of Silicon Valley's intense debate over AI's future, Musk announced via a post on X that Grok would soon become open source. This decision aligns Musk with one faction of the tech community advocating for open source AI, which allows for broader access to the technology's framework, thereby facilitating innovation and development of new travel and tourism applications.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from this open-source approach. By enabling more developers and startups to access and innovate with Grok's AI technology, the sector could see advancements in personalized travel recommendations, automated customer service, and enhanced language translation services, enriching the global travel experience.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Meta champion the open-source model, promoting a collaborative and transparent approach to AI development. In contrast, entities like OpenAI and Google opt for a more guarded stance, prioritizing the protection of technology and the financial implications of AI advancements.\n\nMusk's lawsuit and his push for open sourcing Grok underscore a broader narrative of competing visions for AI's evolution, with Musk challenging the industry to reconsider its approach to technology sharing. This stance, according to OpenAI, is driven more by Musk's commercial ambitions than altruistic motives, despite Musk's significant financial capability to influence the AI landscape on par with leading companies.\n\nThe open-sourcing of Grok by Musk could potentially democratize AI technology, paving the way for more inclusive innovation within the travel and tourism industry, thus fostering a more interconnected and accessible world.",travelandtourworld.com,news,Travel And Tour World,,,,,https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Artificial-Intelligence-shaping-hospitality.jpg,eng-9383543,0.2470588235294118,447920604,1

The platform is currently facing opposition from several lawmakers who crafted legislation looking to ban the platform in the U.S., which Congress is planning to vote on on March 13.\n\nAnd now, with TikTok's future up in the air, it looks like its potential downfall has attracted the attention of potential buyers, one who may have an interest in using data from the platform's users to help train its artificial intelligence models.\n\nFormer Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has ""expressed interest"" to ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming that he is looking to buy TikTok from the parent company if it's looking to sell the platform, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRelated: Despite what Elon Musk says, X is failing\n\nKotick was CEO of Activision, which is home to the beloved game Call of Duty, for 32 years. He has come under fire in the past during his time at the video game company for allegedly failing to tackle alleged sexual misconduct that took place at the company's workplace.\n\nKotick is also reportedly looking for partners for his plan to acquire TikTok and expressed the idea to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and others at an Allen & Co. conference last week. The report claims that ""OpenAI could use TikTok to help train its AI models if a partner such as Kotick could raise the capital for such an acquisition."" The report also reveals that the cost to acquire TikTok could be ""hundreds of billions of dollars.""\n\nTraining AI models often involves feeding data to algorithms to help it make accurate predictions or decisions. Many companies looking to train their AI models often look to harvest user data on their platforms to help develop these technologies, which has sparked backlash from users who want their data to remain private.\n\nByteDance has responded to the Journal's report in a statement on March 10 by denying that it has been approached by potential buyers. In an English translation of the statement, ByteDance claimed that the detail in the report is ""untrue"" as ""Yiming has not communicated relevant matters with anyone.""\n\nTikTok is getting the boot from U.S. lawmakers as they claim in a proposed bipartisan bill that banning the platform would ""protect the national security of the United States.""\n\nLawmakers have expressed concerns that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, may give the Chinese government access to sensitive user data on the platform and that the platform itself may contribute to the spread of misinformation online, accusations that TikTok's CEO has denied.\n\nAfter the bill started progressing in Congress, TikTok began sending users a notice on its platform that the app is ""at risk of being shut down in the U.S.,"" and that users should call their local congressional representative and ""speak up now"" before their right of ""free expression"" is taken away.\n\nTikTok also claimed in the notification that banning the app could ""damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience.""",dcourier.com,news,The Daily Courier,,,,,https://westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2024/03/11/in-this-photo-illustration-a-tiktok-logo-seen-displayed-on-a_91F8FCE.jpg,eng-9382858,0.019607843,447920529,1

The decline of international institutions like the UN, falling usage of the dollar as a global currency, human displacement due to climate change and influence of global tech companies will define the new world order in this century,"" said Dr Ram Madhav, President of the India Foundation on the occasion of 'Capital Talks, A Thought Leadership Series', which began with the lecture titled India & The World - A Perspective from Bharat, organised by the Jindal India Institute of O.P. Jindal Global University.\n\n""Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.""\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as ""widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book ""Partitioned Freedom"" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,"" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. ""An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,"" Dr Madhav said.\n\n""We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared.

This modern inconvenience impacts millions worldwide, especially in remote and underserved regions where traditional internet infrastructure falls short.\n\nIn a stride toward global internet connectivity, SpaceX, a company led by Elon Musk, successfully launched 46 additional Starlink satellites into orbit, bolstering its ever-expanding network and bringing the total number of satellites circling Earth to nearly 6,000.\n\nThese satellites are part of the Starlink project, which aims to provide internet access to places that currently lack it.\n\nThe announcement of the recent successful launch came through a tweet from SpaceX, confirming the completion of back-to-back Falcon 9 launches from Florida and California.\n\nMusk further emphasized the achievement, highlighting that the newly deployed satellites collectively possess the capability to process 4 Terabits of data per second. That's a significant amount of data and it means faster internet.\n\nIn February 2023, Starlink made its debut in the Philippines, claiming to offer the ""most advanced broadband satellite internet globally"" and establishing itself as the ""first and largest satellite constellation utilizing low Earth orbit for high-speed broadband internet delivery.""\n\nEven though there are now more satellites up there, it hasn't been entirely smooth sailing. Recently, SpaceX had to remove some satellites due to a potential design flaw.\n\nDespite this setback, Starlink has been making progress, managing to decrease the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another in its network by more than 30 percent for users in the United States.\n\nIn simpler terms, this implies that internet connections provided by Starlink are becoming faster and more responsive for people in the US, leading to a better overall internet experience.\n\nSpaceX is also ensuring that Starlink works with popular smartphones like iPhones and Samsung Galaxies. They're offering different internet plans too, so people can choose the one that best suits their needs.\n\nCurrently, Starlink is also available in the US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.

However, the local power company is anticipating power resumption to come sooner.\n\nTesla and other EV automakers are also facing weakening sales.\n\nGrowth in the global electric-vehicle market is set to slow to 27.1% this year as a reduction in state subsidies makes the cars less appealing to buyers, according to the research firm Canalys.\n\nThe figure follows an estimated growth of 29% in 2023 at 13.7 million units, when government incentives helped the adoption of EVs.\n\nDespite a 20% drop in the average sales price of EVs in 2023, Jason Low, principle analyst at Canalys said that ""insufficient product choices and inconvenient charging experience hampered demand, impacting the market growth of EVs.""\n\nIn January Tesla itself warned investors that vehicle-delivery growth rates would be ""notably lower"" than 2023 levels, with earnings likely to decline given its focus on price cuts.\n\nWeaker-than-expected sales figures from China are also adding to overall pressures on Tesla's aggressive delivery targets.\n\nBulls express concerned\n\nLast week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, lowered his price target by $25 to $320 on the company's shares, saying that electric-vehicle demand was continuing to weaken in key markets including China despite the price cuts.\n\nInvestor Gary Black, another well-known Tesla bull, drew questions from some investors recently after his Future Fund chose to cut its position in the electric-vehicle maker, saying that Wall Street's first-quarter estimates for the electric vehicle maker remain too high.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nDeutsch Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner had a similar view, which he detailed in a March 11 investor's note.\n\nThe analyst said that he expected Tesla's first quarter deliveries and earnings to miss Wall Street's current expectations ""by a wide margin and continue to see material downside risk to full-year 2024.""\n\nHe cited several factors, including low Model 3 production in the U.S. since the company's Highland refresh, a particularly slow Cybertruck ramp up, and overall pressure globally from weak EV demand.\n\nThe analyst also cut his full year delivery estimate to roughly 1.96 million units, which represents only high single digit growth for the year, compared with a prior mid-teens forecast.\n\n""We see pressure on margins and earnings, as the company already announced deep price cuts in both China and Europe earlier in the quarter, and made further moderate price adjustments in February to incentivize vehicle purchases,"" Rosner said.\n\nThe analyst also said that the slower ramp up in Model 3 in the U.S. and an earlier factory shut down as well as the recent arson attack at the Berlin facility will have an impact factory efficiency gains, he said.\n\nWith the new labor costs and the margin dilutive Cybertruck coming on line at the start of 2024, the analyst said that he expect first-quarter margin to slide deeper on a quarter-over-quarter basis, ""with limited room for improvement throughout the year.""",dcourier.com,news,The Daily Courier,daily_courier@dcourier.com,Daily Courier,author,FALSE,https://westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2024/03/11/tesla-extends-production-stop-due-to-vulkan-group-sabotage_ruqhs7b.jpg,eng-9381799,-0.176470588,447919871,6

The company has called Musk's case frivolous and stated that Musk himself supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI.\n\n""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the document read. ""So he brings this action accusing Defendants of breaching a contract that never existed and duties Musk was never owed, demanding relief calculated to benefit a competitor to OpenAI.""\n\nWhy It Matters: Following Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla characterized the legal action as a ""salve on a bruised ego,"" suggesting that Musk's decision to sue was driven by his ego rather than any legitimate grievance.\n\nEarlier, it was also revealed that Musk had once suggested that OpenAI's only path to compete with Alphabet Inc.'s Google was through a merger with Tesla. However, his proposal wasn't met with much enthusiasm and he left the ChatGPT-parent in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has announced that his AI venture, xAI, will open-source the code of its AI chatbot Grok, this week, while also throwing shade at OpenAI by calling the company itself a ""lie.""\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: OpenAI, Closed Source?

Mobile phones were used in Star Trek before they existed in the real world. Writers imagined bionic limbs, military tanks, submarines and the internet before their actual creation. As the American academic John Jordan writes in Robots (2016): ""Science fiction set the boundaries of the conceptual playing field before the engineers did.""\n\nNo technology has been as richly imagined before its commercial launch as artificial intelligence (AI). Science fiction has informed existing concepts of AI, what it is and what it might do, more than any other technology in history. But whose plots are these? In November, Rishi Sunak interviewed Elon Musk. It didn't take long before their conversation turned to science fiction. Musk mentioned his fear of killer robots. Sunak expressed relief that, at least in the films that he had seen, these monsters had an ""off-switch"" that made it possible to shut them down before they could destroy the world.\n\nSunak may have been referring to the story about AI and paper clips. It's a tale that the Oxford professor Nick Boström first told in 2014. It has been repeated many times since and even played a part among the fears that led to the temporary sacking of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI (the company known for creating ChatGPT) last year. The story goes something like this: once upon a time there was an artificial intelligence that was given the task of making paper clips. But as the AI redesigned itself to be more effective (as it had been told to do) it decided that the best way to maximise output was to destroy human civilisation and cover the entire surface of the Earth with paper clips. The End.\n\n""Projection"" is the mental process by which people attribute to others what is in their own minds. There is a lot of this going on in the debate about AI. When Musk talks about his existential fear of AI, he is not really talking about AI - he is talking about himself. Male billionaires like Musk assume that super intelligent machines would act just like they themselves would act (if they were super intelligent). AI would set out to conquer and dominate everything around itself, unable (perhaps unwilling) to think about the wider consequences of its actions.\n\nThe current debate about AI regulation is stuck in a dichotomy between ""boomers"" and ""doomers"". This is an ideological battle between those eager to hasten the benefits of advanced AI - to help us automate work, accelerate medical diagnoses, mitigate the effects of climate change - and those who worry that the machines will kill us all.\n\nFew experts today believe that AI should be shut down entirely (or that it even can be). Most understand that AI comes with certain risks, particularly around privacy violations, creation of biased decision-making systems, mass surveillance and other forms of social control.\n\nBut when Sunak talks about how to best fight the Terminator he is suggesting that Britain's regulatory efforts are concentrated on a set of capabilities that AI doesn't yet have. This focus on hypothetical harm means fewer enforceable handrails on existing applications. The patriarchal imagination is unable to view AI outside of its own tendency to see all relationships as relationships of domination. AI has to be either a ""servant"" to humanity or a ruthless Terminator-like cyborg master. If AI is just a submissive servant it doesn't need to be regulated and Silicon Valley can be left alone to develop the technology for its own profit. But if AI is a ruthless master in the making it should probably be completely banned or at least severely restricted already.\n\nNeither of these positions are helpful when approaching the complex task of regulating AI. Still, the debate seems unable to move on. And it has to do with the stories we have been told.\n\nLike all of the monsters that societies have created over the millennia, present fears of deadly AI illuminate what really makes us anxious as a society.\n\nVampires embodied our fear of sexuality (and disease). Zombies evoked the chilling image of uncontrollable appetites run amok. What is interesting about our current nightmares around AI is that the robots are not motivated by desire or violence. The AI monsters we imagine are almost always guided by a single abstract principle. The machines don't really intend to kill us. The destruction of the human species is merely an inevitable consequence of a system we created ourselves. The workings of it are based on calculated and indisputable logic. It is completely ""rational"". It just happens to also be completely insane.\n\nThe patriarchal imagination has an inbuilt fear of technology because it views it as inherently violent. The dominant image we have of humanity's development is one of the ape who rose to become a bearded male, grabbed hold of a sharp stick, turned it into a spear and aimed it at his surroundings.\n\nTechnology understood like this becomes inextricably linked with our will to conquer the world. This makes us scared of AI. We fear that the machines will do to us what we have already done to others.\n\nWe assume that technology must have begun with a weapon (and that the first inventor must have been a man). But as the science-fiction writer Ursula Le Guin pointed out, ""the spear"" was probably not the original technology. Archaeologists and anthropologists now increasingly believe that sharpened sticks were invented by women to gather foods, and were adapted for hunting only later. If the first tools weren't hunting tools it isn't clear that technology must always seek to crush, dominate and exploit. Female science-fiction authors have often been criticised for not writing ""hard"" science fiction precisely because they have defined technology in this more neutral sense. As Le Guin put it: ""Technology is just the active human interface with the material world."" There is nothing inherently violent about it. Unless we want it to be. But the patriarchal imagination doesn't seem to think it will be up to us to decide this.\n\n""If you build systems that are smarter than humans, well the human era is over. Humans no longer matter,"" a tech investor told the Financial Times.\n\nIt could well be that large language models (such as ChatGPT) are intelligent (and even conscious in some way). But why do people, especially men, take this to mean that machines are going to possess human-like intelligence given the myriad forms of plant and animal intelligent life? Dolphins possess the most sophisticated sonar known to science and plants like the mimosa can learn and remember. Rather than AI being a step on the path to ""human"" intelligence, is it not more likely that it will possess a form entirely of its own?\n\nAI could in this sense be an opportunity to change the way we see our relationship with other life forms on Earth. However, as the science-fiction writer Donna Haraway has pointed out, in most storytelling plants, animals and natural places are mainly ""props, ground, plot space, or prey"". That's how the patriarchal imagination likes them. But this is limiting our ability to understand AI. It makes it difficult for us to compare its ""intelligence"" to any other intelligence but our own. The only potential relationship the patriarchal imagination can see is one of zero-sum competition, and this creates the common fear that AI is coming to ""replace us"".\n\nThere are real economic dangers to this type of reasoning. Headlines such as ""AI could spell the end of human teachers in schools"" risk becoming self-fulfilling. They make continued investment into human teachers less likely and turn this political choice into an inevitability dictated by the forces of technology.\n\nOne of the most misunderstood imaginings about AI is from The Matrix. The film series is often misinterpreted as being about machines enslaving humanity. But the most important machine in the film is The Oracle (portrayed as a wise black woman sitting in a kitchen).\n\nThe Matrix films are about the inability of the machines to separate themselves from their human makers and the need to build a new relationship. When the (human) hero expresses doubt about the capacity of machines to love, he is simply told that perhaps its his own idea of love that is too limited? There is after all a difference between love as a ""human emotion"".\n\nAnd love as a force.\n\nIt is telling how even stories such as The Matrix - from outside of the patriarchal imagination - are distorted and misrepresented by it. It leaves us with the idea of AI as something isolated, potentially violent, separate from nature and obsessed with the will to dominate, compete and exploit. But that is just the patriarchy describing itself, then screaming in fear of its own reflection.\n\nTraditional fantasy and science fiction are often about a virtuous status quo threatened by a dark outsider. The patriarchal imagination embraces and revels in this kind of story because it is about defending the status quo. But as the science-fiction writer NK Jemisin has pointed out: ""As a black woman I have no particular interest in maintaining the status quo."" Therefore, her stories are different. That's why those written by people who are not the ""status quo"" are so useful when it comes to helping us look at AI as something less threatening. Yes, intelligent machines might change everything. Wouldn't that be just wonderful!\n\nToday we often fail to acknowledge how technology is shaped within our preconceived ideas of the world. Instead, we are encouraged to view it as an unstoppable force pushing everything along. All that is left for us is to ""adapt"" ourselves and our economies to technology. Or maybe ""predict"" where it will take us. We don't have much of a say about the destination.\n\nWe talk as if the machines were the active participants in history, and humanity the passive ones. We dance around the machines as if they were deities. Forgetting that we have created them with our own hands. Fed them with data from our own minds. It is a narrative that leaves us both powerless and without responsibility. Owned by our own creations.",newstatesman.com,news,New Statesman,,,,,https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2024/03/12/aimentwitter-800x418.jpg,eng-9384609,0.082352941,447919430,1

Instead, with a 30-point poll lead, it's parroting Tory soundbites\n\nIf you have ever been bored and on the internet, you may have played a ""who said it?"" quiz, in which you are asked to consider two comically similar orators - say, Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and guess which one really uttered the quote. I find myself playing that game a lot lately, except rather than choosing between similar-sounding celebrities it is the Labour party and the Tories.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the Labour leadership give soundbites that could easily be mistaken for the words of a Conservative minister, most notably when discussing the social security system. In a speech to the centre-left Demos thinktank last week, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, stressed ""a life on benefits"" would not be an option under her party. It is not simply that such a statement is clearly nonsense - if ""a life on benefits"" is even possible, it is less a life of luxury and more one where claimants can't afford toilet roll - but that it is not even original. Kendall's phrasing was almost identical to the words of the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, who, in November, said, ""Benefits shouldn't be there for ever if they're not required.""\n\nMeanwhile, as the number of people who are out of work long-term continues to rise, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, appears to be aiming not only to mimic her counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, but to outdo him. Asked what she would do differently to the budget last week, Reeves told the BBC that, among other measures: ""We need to get people back to work. There are 700,000 more people due to be on sickness benefits"", as if the problem with the past decade of Conservative rule is that it has been too soft on benefits claimants.\n\nAnyone who is surprised by this has not been paying attention. Each time Keir Starmer has refused to commit to repealing a Tory benefit cut over the past year, his robotic delivery of the dog whistle of being on the side of ""working people"" has given the same message: the grownups are in charge and they can give directions to the local food bank.\n\nIn many ways, this is old ground for the Labour party. When George Osborne framed post-2010 austerity as a means to fix Labour's ""out of control"" benefits bill, the leadership at the time - first Ed Miliband and then interim leader Harriet Harman - adopted the narrative with the air of a sinner looking to repent, culminating in the party abstaining from the vote on the government's toxic welfare bill. In 2015, Reeves - then shadow work and pensions secretary - famously declared Labour was ""not the party of people on benefits"".\n\nSuch capitulation is in part a rational response to a media ecosystem in Britain that enables a small group of rightwing newspapers to shape Labour's policy agenda, painting the party as economically unsound the minute it attempts to make ordinary people's lives slightly better. But it is also a trap of the party's own making. Starmer's narrow emphasis on ""fiscal responsibility"" - and Reeves's unnecessary commitment to the government's flawed fiscal rules - enables the Conservatives to set the agenda and buys into, rather than challenges, established wisdom on the legitimacy of public spending. It is not a coincidence that the spending that is deemed irresponsible is typically for the benefits system or wider welfare state. Tax breaks for a CEO's investment portfolio are prudent, while funding for a disabled person's care worker is wasteful.\n\nWe see this again when Labour parrots the government's economic language. In response to the budget, Starmer declared ""the national credit card is maxed out"" while Reeves opted for the old chestnut, ""There's no magic money tree."" Adopting such framing is not just economically illiterate, it fences Labour in for how a future government can raise funds and spend them. Before you know it, Reeves is announcing that - now that Hunt has taken her non-dom tax revenue policy - she intends to pay for the NHS and school breakfasts through (wait for it) ""future savings to public spending"". Who needs a wealth tax when you can squeeze councils facing bankruptcy?\n\nPut together, such narratives have very clear implications. They tell us that under a Starmer government, the wealthy will never be asked to pay their fair share in tax. When pushed, it is those with the least - poor, sick and disabled people - who will be expected to give the most.\n\nThere is an argument that Labour will be different once in power, that the attitudes currently on display aren't real values, but rather a sensible caution the party must display in order to be electable. Perhaps. But if Labour cannot find its moral compass when it is almost 30 points ahead in the polls, it hardly will when it is buried under the weight of day-to-day government. That Rishi Sunak has just hinted at further tax cuts for workers paid for by a squeeze on welfare makes it even more pressing for the official opposition to actually present an alternative.\n\nBesides, the narrative that the Labour party carves out now does not exist in a vacuum, the equivalent of chip paper that'll be in the bin the morning after election day. It permeates the political culture, stoking a race to the bottom and encouraging the public's worst instincts while pushing the dial further away from the change that's needed. If you reinforce the fear that disabled and sick people are a burden on the struggling taxpayer, there is less pressure to address real insecurity such as low wages and crumbling services once in office. If you put the responsibility for the gaps in the labour market firmly on the individual now, there will soon be less focus on the structural issues - from long NHS waiting lists to poor housing - that are actually causing them.\n\nWhen the election comes and the Tories are at last ousted, a Labour government will have an unenviable inheritance: a population that is sicker and poorer than a decade ago and a public realm that is in rapid decline. But a nation's health is not defined by its material conditions alone. It is defined by its social fabric: whether each of us is willing to chip in for the good of the collective, and our attitudes towards those who appear different or have less. There is much discussion about how Reeves wants to make Britain attractive for the rich, but perhaps it is time to focus on making it appealing for the poor. In a parallel universe, there is a Labour party that is putting as much effort into courting the votes of benefits claimants as bankers. In the end, some people matter and others don't.",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,frances_ryan@theguardian.com,Frances Ryan,author,FALSE,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bd4fe23858d02c3c6b5173d36611e0ffbb58f59/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=b9570562416f99a0b4baa6d81c113325,eng-9381729,0.2705882352941176,447919418,1

""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it doesn't make the car autonomous and requires a ""fully attentive driver"" who can ""take over at any moment""\n\nSix weeks before the first fatal U.S. accident involving Tesla's Autopilot in 2016, the automaker's president Jon McNeill tried it out in a Model X and emailed feedback to automated-driving chief Sterling Anderson, cc'ing Elon Musk.\n\nThe system performed perfectly, McNeill wrote, with the smoothness of a human driver.\n\n""I got so comfortable under Autopilot, that I ended up blowing by exits because I was immersed in emails or calls (I know, I know, not a recommended use),"" he wrote in the email dated March 25 that year.\n\nNow McNeill's email, which has not been previously reported, is being used in a new line of legal attack against Tesla over Autopilot.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers in a California wrongful-death lawsuit cited the message in a deposition as they asked a Tesla witness whether the company knew drivers would not watch the road when using its driver-assistance system, according to previously unreported transcripts reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Autopilot system can steer, accelerate and brake by itself on the open road but can't fully replace a human driver, especially in city driving. Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it doesn't make the car autonomous and requires a ""fully attentive driver"" who can ""take over at any moment"".\n\nThe case, set for trial in San Jose the week of March 18, involves a fatal March 2018 crash and follows two previous California trials over Autopilot that Tesla won by arguing the drivers involved had not heeded its instructions to maintain attention while using the system.\n\nThis time, lawyers in the San Jose case have testimony from Tesla witnesses indicating that, before the accident, the automaker never studied how quickly and effectively drivers could take control if Autopilot accidentally steers towards an obstacle, the deposition transcripts show.\n\nOne witness testified that Tesla waited until 2021 to add a system monitoring drivers' attentiveness with cameras - about three years after first considering it. The technology is designed to track a driver's movements and alert them if they fail to focus on the road ahead.\n\nThe case involves a highway accident near San Francisco that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal.\n\n""If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,"" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot. Tesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill declined to comment. Anderson did not respond to requests. Both have left Tesla. McNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Anderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNEARLY 1,000 CRASHES\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use. The agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts. The fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving. ""There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,"" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves. It disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up ""enhanced"" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features. The $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'READY TO TAKE CONTROL'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law. The former Tesla president's message, he said, ""corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles"".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript. Reuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behavior. After a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n""Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,"" he said. ""It is not the neophytes.""\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions. Autopilot might make an ""unexpected steering input"" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver ""is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake"".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n""I'm not aware of any research specifically,"" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n""I cannot,"" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLULLED INTO DISTRACTION\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: ""Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.""\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n""The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,"" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman. ""I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.""\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers ""adhere to their continuous driving responsibility"".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading U.S. product-testing companies. Its road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n""Autopilot usually does a good job,"" Funkhouser said. ""It rarely fails, but it does fail.""\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by David Clarke, Peter Henderson and Brian Thevenot)",zawya.com,news,Zawya.com,,,,,https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/MTBjYjE0MTItNjVkNy00/3/tesla-musk-steering-suspension.jpeg?f=3%3A2,eng-9386232,-0.035294118,447917408,1

Don't get me wrong, I loved Poor Things and I think Emma was sensational in it. But when it comes down to best actress, I think Lily Gladstone's performance will be felt for many more years to come.\n\nNB: I was pretty angry. Like, probably, Emma Stone herself, I was expecting Lily Gladstone to win. They'd won the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild award and it seemed like a lock. Not just because of the opportunity to do something historic (they would have been the first Indigenous person to win an acting Academy Award) and take a huge step forward, but just because they gave the best performance. Of course, that's subjective. And I thought Emma Stone was great in Poor Things and gracious in her win. (There are some showbiz-insidery theories as to why Lily lost here.)\n\nKS: I agree. Sure, Emma was great in a quirky movie that will probably have a cult following in a decade's time but Lily gave us something so substantial, so powerful, and so grounding that it was truly shocking she didn't win. It felt like an even bigger blow to have members of the Osage Nation there to support Lily and the film which ultimately lost every award it was nominated for at the Oscars.\n\nNB: What do you think it would have meant for Lily Gladstone to win?\n\nKS: It's hard to overstate the power of Lily winning the Oscar. The first Native American woman to be nominated for best actress and could've been the first to win. There's been quite a critical view of awards shows recently because of their inability to acknowledge people of colour or balance the gender gap between nominees and winners so it felt like the Oscars had a real moment to award someone for both genuine merit and significance and they decided against it.\n\nNB: After the #OscarsSoWhite reckoning in 2015, the Academy promised to make changes, including a diversity requirement for best picture nominees. And even though things have changed, it can feel like nothing has when something like this happens. To make matters worse, we still have geniuses like Elon Musk calling it a ""woke contest"" and whatever this person is complaining about.\n\nKS: How do you think Lily's loss sits within the long history of problematic portrayals of Native Americans in movies?\n\nNB: Well, I am very much into justice when it comes to movies. I love movies. I love old movies.\n\nKS: You are a lover of movies, yes.\n\nNB: Because I love movies, I've had no choice but to love and appreciate old movies, products of their time, which participated in highly questionable, if not downright criminal, practices when it came to marginalised people. I don't tend to want to persecute the people who made those movies or condemn the movies themselves. I prefer to see things rectified now.\n\nKS: I think that's why I tend to not watch many old movies or look too far back because not only will I feel uncomfortable by some of the representations but because I'm far more interested in how we make movies now and who we allow to tell stories.\n\nNB: That is understandable. Also, because I love movies, I tend to prefer to see that rectification and evolution happen within films of high quality. So, to me, this was a slam dunk. Killers of the Flower Moon was certainly flawed, perhaps fundamentally, in its inability to avoid its own white lens. But I still thought it was a really good movie. And I thought Lily was really good in it. This was the perfect opportunity for ""Hollywood"" to make the right choice. And they blew it.\n\nKS: Exactly. It felt like there was this weight resting on the shoulders of the Academy Awards that had been building up for years -- a weight that might be somewhat lifted when Lily Gladstone won. So for her to lose felt not only anticlimactic but also like a bit of a punch in the gut. It made me think: what else do we have to do as Indigenous people to be recognised for our stories? Especially when we tellthose stories with such power and stoicism.\n\nNB: When I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, I felt that weight you're talking about. I felt it even more acutely when Lily was nominated. It feels silly, but I thought, ""This might help make things right, just a little bit."" The movie is partially about Hollywood's complicity in how it severely butchered the telling of Indigenous stories. The stage was set!\n\nIt felt like we were going to finally move on from things like the super white Dances with Wolves, which won best picture and director in 1991 (and, to be fair, is seen as a step forward in Indigenous portrayal on film). It felt like we were moving on from the booing of Sacheen Littlefeather at the 1973 Oscars ceremony, where she declined, on Marlon Brando's behalf, to accept the best actor award for his role in The Godfather, citing the ""treatment of American Indians today by the film industry"".\n\nThat treatment includes the practice of red face, ""Cowboys and Indians"", horrendous stereotyping, story after story positioning Native Americans as the enemy of righteous white people.\n\nNB: Sometimes I have to remind myself that this is an awards show where people working in show business give each other prizes. No one's curing cancer.\n\nKS: Unfortunately they do not, although I'm sure they've cured cancer in Barbieland.\n\nNB: Let's hope so. But I do think that movies matter. And the prizes we give them matter -- they assign cultural value.\n\nKS: These are the films that help us make sense of the world around us. They help us navigate our own lives so the awards they win do send a signal of what's worthy and what's not.\n\nNB: Right. So even when they get it ""wrong"", they're still showing us what is important. Granted, it's what's important to an elite group of people within the film industry, but they're the decision-makers. They're part of the community that produces movies. So their choices are hard to dismiss.\n\nKS: Exactly, the powers that be who decide which movies get what awards are the same who greenlight scripts or pump money into productions so if the films that win are from a resoundingly white focal point, it's hard not to see how stories similar to those will be made ad nauseum.\n\nNB: It definitely makes me feel like the reports of the Academy evolving past its traditionally conservative voting habits were greatly exaggerated.\n\nKS: I remember when La La Land won several awards and it shocked me because I didn't think it was that great of a movie. Then when the mishap occurred where it was incorrectly announced it had won best picture over Moonlight, for a brief period I thought, 'How can a movie about two white people dancing be more significant than a story of a Black drug dealer helping to raise a young gay Black kid and navigate his life?' It felt like all the film bros had won before the mistake was corrected and Moonlight was revealed as the true winner. What I guess I'm saying is that Moonlight's significance to the culture, and its place in society, was only really acknowledged because it had won the Oscar.\n\nNB: So where do we go from here?\n\nKS: How does the Academy reckon with the fact that it still won't give awards to Native actors, even when they've undeniably delivered the best performance of the year?\n\nNB: Yeah, this was a blow. A Native American person just gave an enormous performance in an enormous movie and it wasn't enough to win. So it's easy to be left with a feeling of ""What does it take?!""\n\nAs of 2020, Native American representation in film was 0.3 - 0.5%. In 2021, Indigenous people were calling for change. That makes this loss sting all the more. Also, some sports teams in the US still use stereotypical Native American iconography for their mascots and apparel -- and the conversation around changing them gets really stupid really fast. (Lily actually criticised the Kansas City Chiefs' ""Tomahawk chop"" before they won the Super Bowl.)\n\nKS: Do you think there's any reason to be optimistic?\n\nNB: Well, maybe. First of all, Lily has been everywhere since Killers of the Flower Moon came out. The Oscars may not have given them the top prize, but it was clear what the culture valued. We wanted Lily to win. That's why they were trending on Twitter. That's something.\n\nKS: I do truly hope that this is the beginning of Lily's meteoric rise in Hollywood and she's able to grace the big screen more. Not just with Native stories, because true representation is being able to have Native women and people play roles that aren't defined by their identity.\n\nNB: Absolutely. The Academy got it wrong this time and they'll get it wrong again. But the culture will keep moving forward. There's no other choice.",junkee.com,news,Junkee,jenna_guillaume@junkee.com,Jenna Guillaume,author,FALSE,https://junkee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lily-gladstone-oscars-FB-1200-x-630-px.png,null,0.4431372549019608,447916447,1

The Times reported that half of the foundation's donations had links to Musk or his businesses. Set up in 2002, the foundation's website has a very plain looking design that is devoid of graphics.\n\nElon Musk might be best known for his entrepreneurial endeavors, but the man also engages in philanthropy.\n\nIn 2002, the billionaire started his charity platform, the Musk Foundation, with his brother, Kimbal. In 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to the foundation.\n\nBut its website appears to be fairly sparse for an organization endowed with billions of dollars from Musk's fortune.\n\nThe Musk Foundation's website is, essentially, just a white webpage with seven lines of text, with no graphics or videos. The site only lists the various causes the foundation supports, ranging from renewable energy and space exploration to artificial intelligence.\n\nIts relatively plain design differentiates it from the slick webpages of other tech-billionaire-funded platforms, like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe website's simple graphic design doesn't mean Musk isn't sending funds the foundation's way. According to a Bloomberg report in December 2022, the Musk Foundation donated $160 million to nonprofits in 2021, including $55 million to the St Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, The New York Times reported that about half of the Musk Foundation's donations in 2021 and 2022 had links to Musk, his staff, or his businesses.\n\nThe Musk Foundation also regularly falls short of the minimum required donations under tax laws, The Times reported, citing tax filings it had obtained.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",businessinsider.nl,news,Business Insider Nederland,,,,,https://i.insider.com/65efc067ce7f1785b2e8b670?format=jpeg,eng-9382216,0.2627450980392156,447915942,4

The original -- and still biggest -- cryptocurrency surged to a record high of more than $72,000 on Monday, having more than tripled in value in the space of a year. Other crypto tokens, such as ethereum and dogecoin -- beloved by Elon Musk -- have also been rallying, with the estimated value of the market climbing to above $2.7tn for the first time in more than two years.\n\nThe funny thing is, though, that there's a chance you have actually not heard. There's not so much talk about which token is next going ""to da moon"" or so many instances of ""Wen Lambo?"" this time around. Newspapers aren't running stories about how hilariously rich everyone is getting apart from you. Worldwide search traffic for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" has climbed in recent days but it is still only about half the level it was the last time a record was hit in 2021, according to Google Trends.\n\nNo, crypto in 2024 (so far, at least) is a rather more subdued affair. And the reason is that the factors reckoned to be driving rising prices are far from the kind of wild crazes we've seen before, such as the mania for initial coin offerings in 2017 or for non-fungible tokens in 2021.\n\nInstead, there are some rather more prosaic things going on. These are: supply and demand dynamics in the lead-up to the ""halving"" expected in April, when the number of new bitcoins mined every 10 minutes halves to 3.125; the prospect of lower interest rates; and institutional capital flows into the 11 bitcoin-based exchange traded funds approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year.\n\nThe last factor is probably having the most impact. More than $50bn has poured into bitcoin ETFs, according to data from crypto platform The Block, with the one launched by BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, already the firm's third-biggest exchange-traded product and the fastest ETF ever to reach $10bn. Some of the world's biggest banks -- Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America -- are all reportedly lining up to get involved in bitcoin, too. (The painful lessons of the financial crisis, about avoiding high-risk, toxic assets, have been forgotten, it seems.)\n\nThe buyers using these new ETFs are conventional investors who see it as a way of diversifying, rather than true believers. So you might think bitcoiners would be unimpressed by their anarchic cryptocurrency -- whose raison d'être is, it seems, to circumvent such middlemen and provide a decentralised, censorship-resistant form of money -- being overtaken by the world of traditional finance. Bitcoin has always been about sticking it to the man, surely, not making rich banker-men richer.\n\nBut you would be wrong. ""The OTC desks are running out of $BTC. This is why we are pumping so hard. Institutional FOMO is starting now, $100k will come very soon,"" posted one much-followed crypto account on X. ""I've become pro-ETF, because . . . anyone who's got some kind of exposure is now incentivised to be Team Bitcoin,"" said Peter McCormack recently on his What Bitcoin Did podcast. ""Let's just say it's good to have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on your side. This is the great thing about bitcoin -- all our incentives align.""\n\nHe's right, of course: when something is backed only by belief, you want as many believers as you can get. But this does rather give the game away about what motivates people to be on ""Team Bitcoin"".\n\nThe institutional investors entering the market do not believe bitcoin is the future of money, nor that it will revolutionise and overthrow the financial system; these companies are the financial system. They buy bitcoin because they calculate they can eke out extra returns by doing so. Furthermore, Fink is not really Team Bitcoin at all -- he has said he also ""see[s] value"" in an ethereum ETF.\n\nThe reality is that the embrace of crypto by the world of traditional finance, or ""TradFi"", as crypto types like to call it, is just as hypocritical as crypto's embrace of institutional investors. I heard one of the hosts of another bitcoin-focused podcast, the Wolf of All Streets, say recently that ""TradFi is just as degen"" -- a crypto word describing a reckless (and degenerate) gambler -- ""as the crypto community is"" and this, unfortunately, is not wholly unjustified.\n\nWith the advent of bitcoin ETFs, what was once a relatively clear boundary between crypto and conventional finance has been broken down for good. And the world of TradFi has shown the emptiness of its talk of learning the lessons of the financial crisis. It has shown that -- like the world of crypto -- it is really just as greedy as ever.",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,,,,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F8afddc37-0ccc-497e-88bb-ae02feac1561.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9385170,0.1843137254901961,447915906,1

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n""Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.""\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings.\n\n""We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,"" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise ""is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,"" not as a safety feature.\n\nDifferent assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n""This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,"" Mercedes said in a statement. ""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

Recently these included a 9mm Glock with ammunition for $500, Bolivian cocaine for $1,000 an ounce and fraudulently cloned bank cards for $5,000.\n\n""Keep your orders coming,"" the anonymous channel owner writes on his public feed, inviting his followers to message him directly to make a purchase in bitcoin or US dollars. He intersperses his adverts with photos of piles of cash and screenshots of messages of appreciation from happy customers. ""Don't sleep guys it's Christmas around the corner let's get on it!!!"" he exclaims.\n\nThe gun shop is just one of tens of thousands of Telegram groups and channels tracked by criminology and cyber security experts. They argue that the social media app has become the new ""dark web"", where lawbreakers and cyber hackers brazenly boast about and barter over illicit services without repercussions.\n\n""Telegram is social media for organised criminals,"" says Haywood Talcove, chief executive of LexisNexis Risk Solutions' government division, who has been tracking new means of fraud targeting US government systems that he says have gone ""viral"" on the platform among some hacker communities. ""It's virtually the wild west out there.""\n\nThe explosion of Telegram's criminal underworld is just one facet of the platform's broader, dizzying rise in recent years, from a niche messaging app to an indispensable news source and resource for organising, including in geopolitical and humanitarian crises such as the Russia-Ukraine war or Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nSince its founding in 2013, Telegram's Russia-born chief executive Pavel Durov has sought to cast the platform as a privacy-orientated alternative to Big Tech platforms, one that is unassailable from government interference. It is, he insists, a censorship-resistant safe haven for citizens living in repressive regimes, such as Belarus, Iran and Hong Kong.\n\n""In some markets, Telegram is one of the few remaining free platforms where people can express themselves,"" Durov says. Counting Asia as its largest market, Durov says the platform has 900mn monthly active users, up from 500mn at the beginning of 2021.\n\nDurov, 39, rarely gives media interviews; his last was in 2017. A hands-on leader, he prefers the title ""product manager"" to chief executive. Remarkably, Telegram has only 50-or-so full-time staff, including a team of 30 elite handpicked engineers. ""No feature is launched without my deep involvement,"" he says.\n\nThanks to new Twitter-like broadcast features and its anything-goes approach to moderation, Telegram has become a megaphone for global leaders -- and strongmen. It is wielded by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, official Russian ministries, and even militant groups such as Hamas.\n\nIt also acts as a magnet for the lawless, for disinformation pushers, conspiracy theorists and extremists fleeing the tighter restrictions on rivals such as Meta's Facebook and Google's YouTube. Experts warn it is increasingly weaponised for propaganda by the very governments whose citizens may rely on it for information.\n\nHeadquartered in Dubai, Telegram has been able to escape much of the regulatory scrutiny and law enforcement demands that have plagued similar platforms in Silicon Valley in recent years. ""In Dubai the government doesn't bother us,"" Durov says, labelling the emirate ""neutral"".\n\nBut as Telegram continues to scale, monetise via advertising and gear up for a potential market debut, possibly in the US, it will face increasing pressure to tame its dark underbelly.\n\n""Investors should be worried about the criminal underworld and also the broader integrity issues at Telegram,"" says Jeff Allen, co-founder and chief research officer for the Integrity Institute, a US think-tank.\n\nAs global regulators circle, ""there is a bit of a rude awakening awaiting Telegram, when they are going to have to meet basic trust and safety and integrity measures that they are very far away from today,"" he adds.\n\nIn many ways, Durov is like any billionaire tech founder in Silicon Valley.\n\nDespite having a reported net worth of $11.5bn, he religiously sports a custom-designed all-black ensemble in keeping with the dogma, ascribed to Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, that minimalism yields extra productivity. He indulges in the typical health fads. Each morning, he says, with ""no exceptions"", he wakes and embarks on 200 push-ups and 100 sit-ups before taking an ice bath. Over the years, he has insisted he is a diehard free speech libertarian.\n\nBut setting him apart from Valley executives is his personal experience of oppression which, Durov says, laid the foundation for his vision for Telegram.\n\nPer his telling, Durov and his brother Nikolai first developed Telegram as a ""private tool"" for the pair to communicate when there were no other secure messaging apps available. (Nikolai remains chief technology officer today.) The Edward Snowden revelations of mass surveillance of Americans by US intelligence prompted their decision to share the app with the public in 2013, emphasising its use as an anti-surveillance messaging platform where encryption technology is used to shield messages from the prying eyes of governments.\n\nHowever, Durov, who also co-founded Russia's most popular social media network, VKontakte, was in 2014 forced to flee St Petersburg after he refused to share the data of certain Ukrainian users of VK with Russia's security agency, the FSB. He sold his stake in the company to Kremlin-friendly oligarchs, which, combined with a cryptocurrency fortune, allowed him to travel and fund Telegram before settling in Dubai.\n\nIn 2018, he again denied Moscow access to certain user data, prompting a ban of the platform in Russia. Embarrassingly for the Kremlin, this was circumvented by Telegram through certain technical manoeuvres. The Kremlin lifted the ban two years later, but for some, Telegram's reputation had been cemented as a free speech app of choice, while Durov was cast as a freedom fighter with coding ingenuity.\n\n""This trust in Telegram is a trust in Durov personally -- that he will do everything to keep free speech alive personally,"" says Aleksandra Urman, a researcher at the University of Zurich who has studied extremism on the platform.\n\nThe approach has helped supercharge Telegram's growth. The app has expanded from its focus on ""secret chats"" to integrating dozens of new features each year, including a customisable interface, tools for sharing large files, groups of up to 200,000 members, and channels -- for one-way broadcasting of messages -- with unlimited subscribers.\n\nInternally, Durov, who sees Meta as his greatest competition, has pursued the old-school start-up mentality of ""move fast and break things"". He has built a small and secretive team of engineers in Dubai by hosting online programming contests and tapping the champions, regardless of their age, location or prior experience.\n\nA team of only seven system administrators manages more than 80,000 servers, owned by the company and distributed globally, which Durov says would typically take hundreds of people to manage. ""The team didn't have any option other than to automate things at an extreme level,"" Durov explains. ""As a result, we became so greatly cost efficient.""\n\nHaving raised around $2bn in debt financing in recent years, Telegram has been attempting to monetise, largely through introducing an advertising platform and subscription revenues. Durov claims it is nearing profitability after two years of trickling out its advertising offering in certain markets.\n\nTelegram's longer-term sales pitch is to become a one-stop shop allowing developers to build ecommerce, gaming and crypto apps into the platform, becoming one of the few mainstream companies to embrace decentralised ""web3"" technology.\n\nThis ecosystem will be underpinned by the TON blockchain, which was initially developed by the Telegram team and drew in individual and institutional Russian investors among others, but is now developed independently of the company by an open source community, after the project ran into regulatory troubles in the US.\n\nDurov says he expects to reach ""a billion monthly active users within somewhere between 12 and 14 months"".\n\nThe plans come as Telegram moves towards a potential market debut, a strategy that will allow for expansion and avoids merging or selling. Durov says he believes founders should retain control to avoid ""sacrificing [their] values"".\n\nHowever, enticing western investors in particular may mean tackling damaging claims by critics that the Kremlin may still have links to or leverage over Telegram. They note that shortly after Russia's abrupt unbanning of Telegram in 2020, Russian ministries and top officials raced to set themselves up on the platform.\n\nDurov will gladly talk about his morning fitness routine but he avoids answering when asked his position on President Vladimir Putin or the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ""Let's not go there,"" he says, adding that it is ""very important for the world to retain Telegram as a neutral platform"".\n\nDurov dismisses reports of Kremlin ties as ""conspiracy theories"", insisting that the platform does not have any ""sources of funding related to Russia"", nor offices, employees or equipment in the country. Most of its bondholders are global funds headquartered in the UK and US, he adds.\n\n""I think for anyone who followed my story, my experiences, the series of events that made me leave Russia more than 10 years ago, it's pretty obvious that such theories are not credible,"" he says.\n\n""Two years ago I could get very irritated and start pointing out the inconsistencies or the inaccuracies in the stories. But then I realised, it's inevitable [as we scale]. We'll see more stories like that, coming from all kinds of actors.""\n\nSome bondholders are satisfied by this. ""Pavel has been quite successful at disconnecting the Russian connection. He's done all the right things,"" says one, speaking on condition of anonymity. They add that Durov was ""creative in coming up with new revenue streams"" and has already clinched a big advertising deal. ""I am very optimistic that it will be a $100bn company.""\n\nNevertheless, critics question whether Telegram has the proper policing to attract more mainstream advertising and investors. Research shows that the platform has become a hotbed of criminal activity.\n\n""Telegram supports and facilitates online and offline crimes all over the world -- it may be fraud, it may be gun sales, drugs sales, people sales even,"" says David Maimon, professor in the department of criminal justice and criminology at Georgia State University, who has been monitoring and infiltrating thousands of Telegram criminal groups and channels since 2019, including 10,000 in the US.\n\nA recent report by the New York Times found Telegram was home to discussions among professed paedophiles trading information.\n\nDurov says that Telegram actively moderates criminal activity on the public parts of the platform and removes ""millions of pieces of harmful content"" daily. It responds to user reports and proactively uses custom machine-learning moderation software to flag illicit content, he adds.\n\nBut some are doubtful that advertisers will be amenable to spending their social media budgets on a comparatively risky platform. ""Telegram is going to really struggle to find advertisers willing to associate their brands with the large amount of toxic content on the platform,"" says the Integrity Institute's Allen, noting that advertisers have pulled millions of dollars from Elon Musk's X for similar reasons. ""The lack of integrity of the platform severely limits [Telegram's] revenue possibilities.""\n\nIncreasingly, as Telegram has become a tool for wartime communications, so too has it become a battleground for information warfare.\n\nTelegram is often the platform where dubious claims are seeded, researchers say, before spreading elsewhere. Propaganda is rife. As the Russia-Ukraine war has unfolded, dozens of channels sharing unverified claims and news, purportedly run by anonymous Russian government ""insiders"", have become more prominent and influential.\n\nIt is the only platform that continues to allow Iran-linked militant groups to operate and disseminate their content, including Hamas, Hizbollah and a variety of Iraqi militia groups. The company says that channels focusing on current developments in Gaza or Ukraine have ""proven indispensable for journalists, researchers, fact-checkers, and human rights organisations looking to independently evaluate these events as they unfold"".\n\nExperts warn that Hamas and other Palestinian militants have weaponised Telegram. On October 7, during its attack on Israel, Hamas proliferated gruesome imagery and videos on the platform in what experts have called an act of psychological warfare on Israeli citizens, who had no official counter information in the invasion's immediate aftermath.\n\nLast month, it emerged in the Israeli press that a psychological warfare unit of the IDF, or Israel Defense Forces, had run an unauthorised Telegram Channel entitled ""72 Virgins -- Uncensored"" that posted graphic and violent content, such as videos of corpses, allegedly Hamas members, targeted at its own citizens.\n\nTelegram's published community guidelines around moderation are bare-bones. They state that it does not allow spam and scams, illegal pornography or the promotion of violence on ""publicly viewable Telegram channels"". Its rules also state that it will block terrorist channels, having eventually succumbed to pressure to remove public Isis groups in 2019 and far-right extremist groups in the US who used the platform to mobilise ahead of the January 6 attack on the Capitol building in 2021.\n\nThe company has a small policy team of around 10 people, as well as several hundred external contractor moderators. But questions remain over how Durov, who is ultimately responsible for decision-making on moderation, is applying the policies.\n\n""Moderation is never easy, and sometimes we're not ready for certain events that unfold in real time and happen very fast. I would argue that in moments like this, no one is ready,"" Durov says. ""Typically feedback from users is please do not start censoring any content -- this was true in Israel.""\n\nFollowing recent pressure to remove Hamas channels, some have now been restricted across the platform. But others remain live. One, Hamasps, with 111,000 followers, appears to be restricted only when accessed via Apple or Android devices, but is available for those accessing via the web. Others are available on Android but not Apple, for example, suggesting that the platform is responding to specific demands applied by app stores rather than blocking access due to its own guidelines. Wired first reported the discrepancies.\n\n""We don't know exactly what is supposed to be taken down. We don't know which measures apply and when -- is a channel taken down fully, is it geoblocked in a certain country, is it only available on web, not Apple or Android?"" says researcher Urman.\n\nShe notes that there have also been several ""politically dubious decisions"", which have ""tarnished"" Durov's reputation as a ""free speech hero"". This includes taking down a bot run by late Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny which gave recommendations on how Russians should vote to unseat politicians from Putin's party. Telegram has previously blamed these instances on pressure from the app stores.\n\nDurov insists the platform has never handed over private chat data to governments. In response to criticism, he has decided to label certain misinformation, rather than take it down, arguing that removing content tends to reinforce conspiracy theories. ""What was considered to be a conspiracy theory yesterday can become the official point of view today. And as a platform, you won't always be able to keep up with the changes,"" he says.\n\nSome reject Durov's standpoint altogether. ""No-holds-barred free speech is a flawed idea,"" says Samuel Woolley, a propaganda expert and assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, arguing that it is ""powerful and highly organised groups"" who have the resources and technical knowhow to co-opt Telegram to manipulate opinion, for example.\n\n""Telegram and other platforms like it are critical tools for free speech and for democracy. But it's also true that these are tremendous tools for control and coercion.""",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,,,,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fb2d773a0-0a1c-45fb-88ca-748b280ddb3e.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9384201,-0.019607843,447915751,1

But that same accessibility can be used by bad actors, too.\n\nMusk didn't elaborate on what aspects of Grok will be open source, what that will look like, or what that might lead to. But he did respond to someone on X in response to his post about open sourcing Grok to say ""OpenAI is a lie,"" so it's pretty clear that this has something to do with the beef between OpenAI and Musk.

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes 'WALK' on Zedropex.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Zedropex.com has no contact information, and its real owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Zedropex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Zedropex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Zedropex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nZedropex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Zedropex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Zedropex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Zedropex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Zedropex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nZedropex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Zedropex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Zedropex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Zedropex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Zedropex.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Zedropex.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table.\n\nWhat to Do If Scammed 😱\n\nIf you've fallen prey to the Zedropex.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims.

TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Zedropex.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nConclusion: Watch Out for Traps Like Zedropex.com 🛡️\n\nThe Zedropex.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡",myantispyware.com,news,My AntiSpyware,,,,,https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zedropex.com-fake-tiktok-promo-code-scam.jpg,null,-0.411764706,447915323,9

The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Nevoltex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Nevoltex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Nevoltex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nNevoltex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Nevoltex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Nevoltex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Nevoltex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Nevoltex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nNevoltex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites.

They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Nevoltex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Nevoltex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" president David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50 per cent and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30 per cent, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the US average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings.\n\nAssisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz , BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the tests, the group said.\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the institute said.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the US average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said.

""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes 'DREAM280', 'exelon', 'ELONUTS' on Elonuts.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Elonuts.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Elonuts.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Elonuts.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Elonuts.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nElonuts.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Elonuts.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Elonuts.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Elonuts.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Elonuts.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nElonuts.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites.

They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Elonuts.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Elonuts.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money.

Meanwhile, Bank of America has widened internal programs for women and people of color to include everyone, and Bank of New York Mellon leaders were advised by lawyers to do away with stringent workforce diversity metrics, Bloomberg reports.\n\nC-suite executives publicly proclaim that their commitment to DEI is as steadfast as ever, with Goldman Sachs and other banking giants saying that they are focused on recruiting and advancing talent from many varied backgrounds, Bloomberg writes. In private, though, many point to highly publicized attacks against DEI -- some of the loudest coming from billionaire cheerleaders including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman -- for fueling fear and angst about the future of these programs, according to the news service.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, corporate CEOs pledged to prioritize inclusive hiring, promotion of people of color and the gender pay gap, Bloomberg writes.\n\nWhile progress has been slow, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup saw improvement of diversity in their senior executive ranks, where Blacks now constitute 3.7%, 5% and 8.7% of head count, respectively, according to those banks' most recent reports, Bloomberg reports. That compares with 2012 to 2016, when Black executives and managers had a decreasing share of head count at the three banks, according to the news service.\n\nFast forward to less than four years later, executives, consultants and attorneys now acknowledge that DEI initiatives focused on recruiting as well as affinity groups, workforce targets and boardroom diversity are under scrutiny, Bloomberg writes.\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson told Bloomberg that the bank consistently reviews its programs and has ""not eliminated any bank-sponsored D&I sponsorship programs.""\n\nBut there have been changes. Citizens Financial Group, in its latest annual regulatory filing, no longer cites its goal of having women and people of color constitute at least half of candidates for mid- and senior-level positions, Bloomberg News reported last week. That change is among more than 12 DEI-related revisions in the annual filings of big U.S. firms this year, Bloomberg reports.\n\n""If you didn't have the conviction in the first place, it's easy to say, 'We're not doing that anymore,'"" Valerie Irick Rainford, who oversaw programs to promote Black leaders at JPMorgan Chase before leaving the bank in 2019, tells Bloomberg\n\nSubha Barry, former head of diversity at Merrill Lynch, who now heads Seramount, a DEI advisory firm, says the industry blowback against DEI is happening. She recounts how white women ask her about opportunities for their sons if large corporations continue to focus on uplifting disenfranchised groups, Bloomberg writes.\n\n""Are they doing it publicly? Vocally? Of course not,"" Barry says. ""But they're doing it. And when they do it, you have to listen.""\n\nAna Duarte McCarthy, former chief diversity officer at Citigroup, remains optimistic for the future of DEI.

Good leadership training needs these...,"Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Gregory Harper, Pro Vice Chancellor, Centre for Organisational Change and Agility, Torrens University Australia\n\nMany of us have done leadership training for work, come back to the office and thought: ""That was a huge waste of time"". Or returned with the best of intentions but realised, six months on, we never actually used any of skills we learned on the course.\n\nSo, what makes leadership development programs effective?\n\nWe spent months researching leadership and management courses, in an effort to develop a new way of thinking about it.\n\nOur new paper, published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications, argues there are five key ingredients needed to make leadership training worthwhile.\n\nSo, what do managers need to know before spending money and time on sending their staff off to leadership training?\n\nRead more:\n\n3 things we need to get right to ensure online professional development works\n\nEffective leaders are self-motivated learners. Basically, if the staff member isn't motivated, they won't learn. So there is no point in managers sending unwilling staff members off to leadership training.\n\nOur research suggests staff need to self-nominate for leadership development courses. Those who put their hand up to this kind of training will be intrinsically motivated learners.\n\nMany leadership courses give guidance on how to approach certain challenges at work, such as managing conflict or leading a change process.\n\nBut this guidance is of little value if the staff member doing the training can't practise their newfound skills.\n\nManagers need to ensure the skills staff members learn at training can be applied and practised. That means giving your staff the time, opportunities and support to use what they learned at leadership training.\n\nManagers need to give their staff who have done leadership training the opportunity to take on new challenges at work in a psychologically safe context (staff will also need their regular workload reduced so they can do this new work).\n\nFor example, the leadership program could run concurrently with a workplace change such as implementing a new system or process. The person doing the leadership training could be supported by their boss to take carriage of this implementation.\n\nEffective learning at work requires a combination of skills. These include:\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to treat leadership training not as a one-off but as part of a broader culture of learning at work.\n\nManagers can support this culture of learning this by, for example, having monthly meetings at which staff can talk openly and constructively about what's worked lately, what hasn't, and why. Managers can also ensure staff are given adequate training on new technologies, so they feel more confident about technological change at work.\n\nManagers may also want to find ways to offer different types of learning opportunities at work. Some staff members will thrive in a group work environment; others will prefer to study a manual themselves, watch an instructional video or do a short online course.\n\nIf managers cultivate a culture of continuous learning at work, it means that when staff go off to leadership training, they will be more able to absorb and apply the lessons.\n\nA crucial feature of leadership training is ensuring there is a high-quality facilitator.\n\nA good course facilitator doesn't just give a lecture and then answer questions. They also help participants find appropriate applied learning projects, help them learn self-reflection skills, and provide coaching and feedback.\n\nThey also play a crucial role in supporting individual and group learning.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to do some due diligence before sending staff off to a leadership training course.\n\nThat might involve reading reviews, getting feedback from people who have already done the course, and carefully checking the credentials of the facilitator.\n\nSuccessful organisations don't just have good individual leaders. They also need collective leadership. That means developing a culture at work that values:\n\nManagers can foster this culture of collective leadership at work by facilitating honest, safe conversations about innovation and change.\n\nIt means making all staff aware it's everyone's job to identify ways the organisation can improve, rather than just relying on one or two leaders.\n\nIt's crucial managers find leadership training courses that can embed this message into their training.\n\nChange is all around us, whether that's climate change, economic change or technological change with the development of AI. The workplaces that will survive and thrive in this era of rapid change are those that take skills development seriously.\n\nTreating leadership training as a box-ticking exercise won't cut it. Good leadership training is crucial to developing good leadership, but managers need to make sure the course is actually worth it in the first place.\n\nRead more:\n\nElon Musk's 'hardcore' management style: a case study in what not to do\n\nRos Cameron is a fellow of AHRI Australian Human Resources Institute.\n\nGregory Harper does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,author,FALSE,null,null,0.066666667,447912955,1

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Bitsconex.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Bitsconex.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Bitsconex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Bitsconex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Bitsconex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nBitsconex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Bitsconex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Bitsconex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Bitsconex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Bitsconex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nBitsconex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Bitsconex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Bitsconex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Bitsconex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Bitsconex.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Bitsconex.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for.

Here's a concise list of steps you should take right away:\n\n🛑 Stop All Deposits and Sharing of Personal Info\n\nCease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website.\n\n🏦 Contact Your Bank Immediately\n\nNotify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Bitsconex.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them.

It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless.

The website features professional designs and sophisticated interfaces, creating an illusion of a genuine investment platform, which lowers the guard of potential investors.\n\n🕳️ Concealed Operations and Network Connections\n\nUpon closer inspection, Atcointrade.com shows typical signs of a scam operation. Direct access to the site may reveal inconsistencies, such as non-functional pages or sudden changes in content. The domain, often newly registered with hidden WHOIS information, is a common trait among fraudulent sites. Advanced tools might uncover that Atcointrade.com is part of a larger network of similar scam sites, suggesting a widespread, organized fraud operation.\n\nThe Atcointrade.com Crypto Scam is not an isolated incident. Digital fraudsters continually evolve their tactics and launch seemingly irresistible offers, aiming to exploit enthusiastic and unsuspecting participants. Here's a list of some recent, similar scams that have been making the rounds:\n\nMrBeast Bitcoin Promo Code Scam on TikTok\n\nThis scam involves fake profiles or posts on TikTok claiming to offer exclusive Bitcoin promo codes from popular YouTuber MrBeast. Users are enticed to enter these codes on scam websites, promising significant Bitcoin rewards. The catch often involves making an initial investment or providing personal information, leading to financial loss or identity theft. Remember, legitimate promotions from public figures like MrBeast will be well-documented across their official channels and platforms.\n\nScammers impersonate Elon Musk or SpaceX on various social media platforms, claiming to offer a crypto giveaway. They may use fake accounts or hacked profiles to appear credible, asking users to send a small amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet address to ""verify"" their account for a larger giveaway. This scam capitalizes on the high profile of Elon Musk and his associations with cryptocurrency, but any requirement to send funds for verification is a significant red flag.\n\nSimilar to the MrBeast Bitcoin scam, this scheme involves scammers claiming that MrBeast is dropping his own cryptocurrency token. Potential victims might encounter this scam through social media ads, direct messages, or email campaigns, urging them to invest early for high returns. The scammers might request transfers of existing crypto to participate or ask for personal details to register for the drop. It's essential to verify such claims directly through MrBeast's official channels before taking any action.\n\nIf you've fallen victim to the Atcointrade.com scam, it's crucial to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and protect your finances. Here's a comprehensive guide on the steps to take:\n\n🏦 Contact Your Financial Institution:\n\nReach out to your bank or any other financial service you used to send money to Atcointrade.com. Explain that the transaction was part of a scam. They might be able to halt the transaction or reverse it if it's not too late. In some cases, they may issue a chargeback. If you've shared your credit/debit card details, ask for a new card to prevent further unauthorized use. Keep a record of any financial losses as they can be crucial for investigations and potential reimbursement.\n\n🔐 Change Passwords:\n\nIf you've shared any passwords with Atcointrade.com or used the same passwords on other sites, change them immediately. This is particularly important for accounts associated with financial institutions or that contain sensitive personal information. Using a reliable password manager can help you maintain strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.\n\n👀 Monitor Your Accounts:\n\nClosely watch your financial statements for the following months. Look out for any transactions you didn't authorize, no matter how small they might seem. Unauthorized transactions could indicate that your account information is being used fraudulently. Consider signing up for a credit monitoring service that can alert you to changes in your credit report, which might suggest identity theft.\n\n🚔 Report the Scam:\n\nReport the scam to the appropriate authorities. This might include your local law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Providing them with detailed information and evidence about your experience can help with their investigations and might prevent others from being scammed.\n\n💻 Secure Your Devices:\n\nIf you've downloaded anything from Atcointrade.com or clicked on any links they provided, your computer or device may be compromised. Run a thorough antivirus scan to check for malware or spyware. If you're unsure how to do this or the scan finds something, you might need to seek help from a professional to clean your device.\n\n📘 Learn About Scams:\n\nEducate yourself on the tactics used in online scams like Atcointrade.com. Understanding how these scams work can help you avoid falling victim in the future. Keep up with news on recent scams and phishing methods by following reputable news sources and official government warnings.\n\n📢 Spread the Word:\n\nInform your friends and family about the Atcointrade.com scam, especially if they're interested in cryptocurrency investments. Sharing your experience can help prevent others from falling into the same trap. Awareness is a powerful tool against scammers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Atcointrade.com Scam is a sophisticated trap set by fraudsters. They lure you in with the promise of high returns on cryptocurrency investments, showcasing a professional-looking website filled with impressive, yet entirely fabricated, financial statistics. What's their real agenda? To convince you to deposit your digital assets into their platform, making you believe in the illusion of lucrative trading success. However, when you try to withdraw your supposed earnings, you're met with a barrage of excuses, effectively locking your funds on their platform. Instead of profiting, you're left dealing with the loss of your investment and a breach of your financial security.\n\nIt's critical to understand that genuine investment opportunities are usually associated with well-established and transparent entities, not obscure websites promising quick riches. The key to safeguarding yourself against such scams is to be vigilant and informed. If an investment opportunity seems excessively promising without any clear risk, it's likely a scam. Always verify the legitimacy of a platform before investing, be wary of sharing sensitive information online, and educate your friends and family about the dangers of such scams to prevent them from falling victim. Implementing strong cybersecurity measures like regular password updates and enabling two-factor authentication can also enhance your protection against online fraud. 🛡️🌐",myantispyware.com,news,My AntiSpyware,,,,,https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atcointrade.com-WHOIS-Lookup.png,null,-0.011764706,447912490,4

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Bebspace.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Bebspace.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Bebspace.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Bebspace.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Bebspace.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nBebspace.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Bebspace.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Bebspace.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Bebspace.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Bebspace.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nBebspace.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Bebspace.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Bebspace.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Bebspace.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money.

They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Bebspace.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online.

Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nConclusion: Watch Out for Traps Like Bebspace.com 🛡️\n\nThe Bebspace.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust.

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\n×\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nYou might be interested in\n\nBreaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969 Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press staff writers Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election",thestar.com,news,The Star,jill_colvin@thestar.com,Jill Colvin,author,FALSE,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/ee/9eeb75f2-ffde-5f85-9371-dbdd16cc1337/65ef4ee9ea74a.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9380150,-0.02745098,447912489,1

TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Bitenexer.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nConclusion: Watch Out for Traps Like Bitenexer.com 🛡️\n\nThe Bitenexer.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡",myantispyware.com,news,My AntiSpyware,,,,,https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitenexer.com-WHOIS-Lookup.png,null,-0.388235294,447912487,9

Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal.\n\n""If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,"" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot.\n\nTesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise.\n\nAnderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNEARLY 1,000 CRASHES\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use.\n\nThe agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts.\n\nThe fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving.\n\n""There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,"" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves.\n\nIt disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane.\n\nThe step-up ""enhanced"" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features.\n\nThe $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'READY TO TAKE CONTROL'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law.\n\nThe former Tesla president's message, he said, ""corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles"".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript.\n\nReuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behavior.\n\nAfter a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n""Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,"" he said.\n\n""It is not the neophytes.""\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions.\n\nAutopilot might make an ""unexpected steering input"" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver ""is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake"".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n""I'm not aware of any research specifically,"" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n""I cannot,"" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLULLED INTO DISTRACTION\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: ""Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.""\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n""The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,"" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman.\n\n""I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.""\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers ""adhere to their continuous driving responsibility"".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading U.S. product-testing companies.\n\nIts road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n""Autopilot usually does a good job,"" Funkhouser said.",fijitimes.com.fj,news,The Fiji Times,,,,,https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-11T155941Z_3_LYNXNPEK2A0CO_RTROPTP_4_TESLA-AUTOPILOT-LAWSUITS.jpg,null,-0.003921569,447912368,1

On February 29, the X boss took legal action against OpenAI and filed a lawsuit against the Sam Altman-led company. In the lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of abandoning its original mission and breaching its founding agreement. Now, OpenAI has sent a legal response to the lawsuit, denying the existence of any agreement and saying that Musk just wants all the success for himself.\n\nThis is the first legal response from OpenAI concerning the lawsuit. According to a report in The Verge, the company, in a court filing, has said that there was no founding agreement with Musk at all and that it is all ""fictional"".\n\n""There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear. The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him,"" the lawsuit states.\n\nIn addition to this, OpenAI, in the filing, also said that Musk ""dropped OpenAI"" when his wishes were not following and looking at OpenAI's technological advancements, he wants ""all success for himself.""\n\n""Were this case to proceed to discovery, the evidence would show that Musk supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI, to be controlled by Musk himself, and dropped the project when his wishes were not followed. Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,' the lawsuit states.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the situation, Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman's OpenAI last week, alleging contract breaches and unfair business practices. Musk claimed that OpenAI's shift towards maximizing profits for Microsoft, rather than serving humanity, contradicted the company's original mission.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Altman had shared an old conversation on X where he supported Musk during a challenging period for Tesla in 2019. A couple of days later, OpenAI had published a blog post containing Musk's past emails to the company's founders, showcasing his previous endorsement of OpenAI's for-profit arm and suggesting a potential merger with Tesla.\n\nIn their blog post, OpenAI also expressed sadness regarding the current state of affairs with Musk.\n\nThe post read, ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired -- someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him.""",indiatoday.in,news,India Today,,,,,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202403/openai-ceo-sam-altman-and-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-014253852-16x9_3.jpg?VersionId=eK_YInyPZg6O6FXqz0pErR7QUQtbsLzN,eng-9383543,0.2156862745098038,447911994,6

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor.

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor.

Those few months he spent in Berlin next to Winston became critical in for humanity in aspect of what corruption can and does to a human being as well as to humanity.\n\nBritons rejected neonazi paedo crown during WW2, but once war was over - even men like Winston Churchill returned to their knees infront of deadly curruption and those who didn't, suffered same faith as to the one George Patton himself have.\n\nGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov who walked on blood of his soldiers, HAVE IN ULTIMATE MOMENT FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE(was so corrupt that he failed to even acknowledge deaths of his fellow men) FACT THAT WW2 VICTORY FROM SOVIET STANCE WAS A VICTORY OF PEOPLE AND NOT INDCASE DIFFERENT FROM INDIVIDUAL(THATS ALSO WHAT MAKES MY CASE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ZHUKOV - I AM IN SITUATION BECAUSE OF TOTAL BETRAYAL OF PEOPLE AGAINST HUMANITY DUE TO BIGGEST CORRUPTION EVER ON A SUPER MASS SCALE) AS WAS AND IS MY CASE - INDIFFERENT FROM THE ONE AGAINST PARASITIC RUSSIAN TSARIST VAMPIRES. His treasures which were confiscated by Soviet Union WERE WELL DESERVED CONFISCATED. AND UNLIKE CASE WAS WITH OTHER GENERALS/OFFICERS WHOM, SOVIET UNION ALLOWED ZHUKOV TO PUBLISH\n\nHIS MEMOIRS WHICH WAS FOR THOSE TIMES UNHEARD OFF. THERE IS 15 MILLION BRITONS THAT DROWN AT THIS MOMENT IN POVERTY AND DO SO TO SATISFY PRIVATE POCKETS OF THOSE WHOM THEY SHOULD GET RID OF IT ALREADY LONG LONG AGO.\n\nBritish are extremely Valenti nation, but in eyes of curruption totally worthless. British won war against nazism during WW2 and pushed paedo crown on outer limits of existence during one(HAD TO KEEP ITS NEONAZI MOUTHS SHUT OR OTHERWISE), but bent on knees infront of one as soon as war ended. Soviet Union never would made through without British and American support during WW2 and nor without so much hated Joseph Stalin who despite all for times during which Soviet military was still in development, did whatever was necessary for country to survive - including execution of some 40.000 officers we see have RETAKEN(same spirit of traitors) control of Russia in its war on people of Ukraine. While I met remnants of Zhukov's family, please do not compare me with one. I have exactly ZERO SIMILARITIES WITH ZHUKOV CALIBERS and don' see myself in absolutely anything in one other than victory he managed to execute on behalf of Soviet people. Zhukov according to my views also became lazy and incompetent loosing waste amounts of people - didn't bother to personally ensure battlefields via horse riding or walking to also keep up in shape prior to operations.\n\nExceptionalism(EGOISM IN CASE OF ZHUKOV - NEVER IN MINE SINCE I WAS STOLEN GIFTS YOU SEE SHUKOV RECEIVED SINCE MY AGE 9 MONTHS ALL STORED IN BELGRADE WAS TOLD AND WHAT I ALSO DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OTHER THAN ADMISSIONS INTO CRIME BY SLOVENIAN AND SERBIAN CHETNIKS IN HONOR TO HUMAN DIGNITY - ROBBED OF LIFE BY TITO AND SO CALLED YUGOSLAVS - PRIMARILY SLOVENES/SERBS AND EVEN CROATS) always was and will remain a mean PAEDO CROWN's weapon of choice - revelation of curruption whichever society they aim at for its divide and conquer plans is indifferent from so called exceptionalism. Never forget about who you are/your background and don't shy from costs you ancestry paid for you to be alive - something paedo crown members never had to deal with. Putin used me with\n\nMedvedev to utterly resale confiscated neonazi memorabilia to West via Zhukov and Stalin's issue after penetrating in absolutely every pore of the Russian society while British paedo crown through the case of Zhukov and similar utterly aimed at uncovering names of executors of Russian bloodsuckers/parasites(ROMANOVS WHO SUCKED BLOOD OF CHILDREN AS WORKFORCE IN MOST BRUTAL HUMAN CONDITIONS - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ALL TAKEN OFF FROM INTERNET BY MEDVEDEV AND PUTIN) in desperate attempt to obviously somehow retaliate.\n\nGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov's relatives involved in so called MK Ultra cried British paedo cabal in front of Putin about being robbed of his possessions on which one personally spent money while in Germany, but I WOULD HAND TREASONOUS SCUM IN MOSCOW SQUARE TOGETHER WITH PUTIN AND MEDVEDEV FOR NATION TO REMEMBER ITS HUMBLE NON PARASITIC(finally non Romanov's) BEGINNINGS WHICH LED INTO SURVIVAL OF WW2 WHICH THEY NEVER EVER WOULD WITH ROMANOVS. BRITISH MANAGED TO DEFEAT/CONQUER ADOLF HITLER DURING WW2, BUT THEY NEVER MANAGED TO LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM PEST THAT HUNTED ENTIRE HUMANITY SINCE DAY 1 AND BUILT ITS WEALTH THROUGH MOST BLOODSUCKING PARASITIC COLLECTIONS(death via total exploitation - and what became death worse even than through human slavery itself) OF LIVES.\n\nDON'T COMPARE ME AND VALUE ME ACCORDINGLY WITH WHITE GUARDS TRASH - OR INTERNATIONAL JEWRY USED AS ESPIONAGE NETWORK BY LONDON/WASHINGTON DC / TEL AVAIV https://ausertimes.blogspot.com/2024/02/about-coming-nuclear-war-as-planned-on_22.html THEY WERE ALL INTERESTED IN SAME THING - GAINING POWER THROUGH GENOCIDE/EXTERMINATION PROCEDURE AND/OR TI CAUSE AS MUCH AS PHYSICAL HARM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE RESOLVING POSTAL PSYCHIATRIC CRIME.

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.",kgou.org,news,KGOU 106.3,,,,,https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ddef2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1726x971+0+378/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Fap24071617990627_sq-ed768c4b296161006592759585febb50f8086b3f.jpg,null,0.019607843,447910946,1

And along the way, they amassed staggering fortunes that have disconnected them from reality.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who broke into a sweat during an on-stage interview with Swisher in 2010, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who once talked to her regularly before cutting off communications after he bought Twitter in 2022, are painted in the harshest light.\n\n""If Mark Zuckerberg is the most damaging man in tech to me, Musk was the most disappointing,"" Swisher writes in her 300-page book.\n\nThat's one of the milder critiques in what's a mostly scathing takedown by one of the most respected and feared reporters covering technology. Her reputation is such that Swisher has become as synonymous with Silicon Valley as the famous entrepreneurs who shaped it since she began covering the industry in the 1990s.\n\nCEOs, including Zuckerberg and Musk, regularly granted her exclusive interviews, fed her scoops and sometimes even secretly called her for advice, according to her book. When the HBO series, ""Silicon Valley,"" needed someone to play an influential reporter in an episode, Swisher was cast as herself - a role she still regularly fills as a technology commentator on major TV networks.\n\nSwisher no longer resides in Silicon Valley. She moved to Washington, D.C., a few years ago, mostly because that's where her wife works, but also because she was feeling a need to escape what had become an increasingly toxic and insular scene.\n\nBut she has remained plugged into - and worried - about what is happening with technology, particularly with the accelerating rise of artificial intelligence and its potential for causing even more damage than she thinks has already been done by social media, smartphones and other products that haven't been tightly regulated.\n\nSwisher told The Associated Press that she hopes ""Burn Book"" serves as shot across the bow of both the technology industry and governments around the world, a warning that the same missteps that happened during the past 20 years must not be repeated as artificial intelligence seeps into all corners of society.\n\n""Don't get fooled a second time,"" Swisher said of what she hopes the book's main takeaway will be. ""We need our government to make these (technology-industry) people accountable and that has not happened. We need them to understand consequences because they certainly haven't done us right on the damaging parts of technology. We need to stop letting them off the hook.""\n\nSwisher initially didn't even want to write another book, partly because she has become more interested in focusing on her Pivot podcast. But she but finally got on a roll after she hired Nell Scovell, who co-wrote a best-selling book with former Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, to help her remember all the stories she accumulated.\n\nThose recollections led her to disassemble some of the world's richest people in her book, but Swisher isn't worried about the blowback.\n\n""I don't care what they think,"" Swisher said. ""The worst thing I do is tell people what I think of them, but I am being truthful.""\n\nMusk, who also runs rocket ship maker SpaceX and social media company X, used a pejorative term for anus to describe Swisher in his last email sent to her in October 2022, according to her book.\n\n""You can see it every day on Twitter (renamed X by Musk), there is something wrong with him,"" Swisher said of Musk during the AP interview. ""He is in desperate need of attention, he is a classic narcissist who has turned into a malevolent narcissist.""\n\nSwisher doesn't spend her entire book bashing tech leaders. She devotes an entire chapter to the industry's ""mensches,"" a list that includes Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, investor Mark Cuban and the late Dave Goldberg, who was CEO of SurveyMonkey and Sandberg's husband when he died in 2015 while on vacation in Mexico. She also has mostly kind words for the likes of former Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Apple CEO Tim Cook and his late predecessor, Steve Jobs.\n\nEventually, Swisher said she hopes she will look back kindly on the tech leaders at the vanguard of AI, especially Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the San Francisco startup behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\n""One thing I do like about Sam is he is able to hold two conflicting ideas in his head at the same time,"" Swisher said. ""Of course, he is going to be a techno-optimist, but he is not a techno-idiot. Now what will be a problem is he just takes whatever he wants, even though he has warned of unsafe things, and then does nothing about them. That's what too many of these tech moguls have done.""",rep-am.com,news,Republican American,bill_o_brien@rep-am.com,Bill O'Brien,author,FALSE,https://cdn.rep-am.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240311-230450-pic-150315200.jpg,null,-0.247058824,447910928,1

Elon Musk's attorney in the OpenAI case is Morgan Chu of Irell & Manella.\n\nElon Musk had sued New York-based Wachtell in the same San Francisco court last year and challenged $90 million in legal fees that the law firm earned as counsel to Twitter in its effort to force Tesla owner to buy the social media platform for $44 billion.\n\nWhat has OpenAI said on Elon Musk's lawsuit?\n\nOpenAI said that Elon Musk had accepted the company's decision to become a for-profit entity as he needed to raise ""billions"" of dollars. The company said in a blog post, ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired -- someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him.""",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,view_all@hindustantimes.com,View All,author,FALSE,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/12/1600x900/ddd_1708086175690_1710213645884.png,null,0.066666667,447910785,31

Good leadership training needs these 5 ingredients,"Torrens University Australia provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU.\n\nMany of us have done leadership training for work, come back to the office and thought: ""That was a huge waste of time"". Or returned with the best of intentions but realised, six months on, we never actually used any of skills we learned on the course.\n\nSo, what makes leadership development programs effective?\n\nWe spent months researching leadership and management courses, in an effort to develop a new way of thinking about it.\n\nOur new paper, published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications, argues there are five key ingredients needed to make leadership training worthwhile.\n\nSo, what do managers need to know before spending money and time on sending their staff off to leadership training?\n\nRead more: 3 things we need to get right to ensure online professional development works\n\n1. The employee must want to be there\n\nEffective leaders are self-motivated learners. Basically, if the staff member isn't motivated, they won't learn. So there is no point in managers sending unwilling staff members off to leadership training.\n\nOur research suggests staff need to self-nominate for leadership development courses. Those who put their hand up to this kind of training will be intrinsically motivated learners.\n\n2. Managers need to let staff use their new leadership skills at work\n\nMany leadership courses give guidance on how to approach certain challenges at work, such as managing conflict or leading a change process.\n\nBut this guidance is of little value if the staff member doing the training can't practise their newfound skills.\n\nManagers need to ensure the skills staff members learn at training can be applied and practised. That means giving your staff the time, opportunities and support to use what they learned at leadership training.\n\nManagers need to give their staff who have done leadership training the opportunity to take on new challenges at work in a psychologically safe context (staff will also need their regular workload reduced so they can do this new work).\n\nFor example, the leadership program could run concurrently with a workplace change such as implementing a new system or process. The person doing the leadership training could be supported by their boss to take carriage of this implementation.\n\n3. Managers need to cultivate a continuous learning mindset\n\nEffective learning at work requires a combination of skills. These include:\n\nself-awareness about one's learning style\n\nbeing open to new learning methods and technologies\n\nbeing able to change the way you do things at work when new opportunities arise\n\nbeing able to regularly reflect on learning experiences, successes and failures.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to treat leadership training not as a one-off but as part of a broader culture of learning at work.\n\nManagers can support this culture of learning this by, for example, having monthly meetings at which staff can talk openly and constructively about what's worked lately, what hasn't, and why. Managers can also ensure staff are given adequate training on new technologies, so they feel more confident about technological change at work.\n\nManagers may also want to find ways to offer different types of learning opportunities at work. Some staff members will thrive in a group work environment; others will prefer to study a manual themselves, watch an instructional video or do a short online course.\n\nIf managers cultivate a culture of continuous learning at work, it means that when staff go off to leadership training, they will be more able to absorb and apply the lessons.\n\n4. Managers need to ensure training is delivered by good facilitators\n\nA crucial feature of leadership training is ensuring there is a high-quality facilitator.\n\nA good course facilitator doesn't just give a lecture and then answer questions. They also help participants find appropriate applied learning projects, help them learn self-reflection skills, and provide coaching and feedback.\n\nThey also play a crucial role in supporting individual and group learning.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to do some due diligence before sending staff off to a leadership training course.\n\nThat might involve reading reviews, getting feedback from people who have already done the course, and carefully checking the credentials of the facilitator.\n\n5. Organisations need both individual leaders and collective leadership\n\nSuccessful organisations don't just have good individual leaders. They also need collective leadership. That means developing a culture at work that values:\n\nlearning\n\ninnovation\n\nbeing adaptable\n\nbeing able to deal with continuous change.\n\nManagers can foster this culture of collective leadership at work by facilitating honest, safe conversations about innovation and change.\n\nIt means making all staff aware it's everyone's job to identify ways the organisation can improve, rather than just relying on one or two leaders.\n\nIt's crucial managers find leadership training courses that can embed this message into their training.\n\nChange is all around us, whether that's climate change, economic change or technological change with the development of AI. The workplaces that will survive and thrive in this era of rapid change are those that take skills development seriously.\n\nTreating leadership training as a box-ticking exercise won't cut it. Good leadership training is crucial to developing good leadership, but managers need to make sure the course is actually worth it in the first place.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk's 'hardcore' management style: a case study in what not to do",theconversation.com,news,The Conversation,,,,,https://images.theconversation.com/files/540320/original/file-20230801-231213-d9k81i.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=48%2C243%2C5421%2C2710&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,null,0.1215686274509804,447910746,1

Peter Chen envisions RFM-1 as a revolutionary solution capable of propelling billions of robots into various sectors, emphasizing the need for adaptable systems.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, the platform's launch aligns with ongoing discussions in the robotics industry regarding the future of ""general-purpose"" systems, particularly with the emergence of humanoid robotics firms. Covariant's software, currently deployed on industrial robotic arms for tasks like bin picking, exhibits hardware agnosticism, promising compatibility with various robotic systems.\n\nRFM-1 is heralded for providing robots with a ""human-like ability to reason,"" a departure from traditional robotic systems programmed for repetitive tasks. In contrast to single-purpose robots, RFM-1 processes real-world data, determining optimal actions based on a deeper understanding of language and the physical world. The platform's interface allows users to input text commands, fostering natural interactions with robots.\n\nCovariant aims to bridge the gap between traditional programming and a more intuitive method for human-robot interaction, promoting efficiency and adaptability. While the claims of a ""human-like ability to reason"" warrant careful consideration, Covariant's RFM-1 showcases a new paradigm in robot decision-making, with potential applications revolutionizing training, programming, and deployment across various industries.\n\nTechTimes earlier reported that Tech mogul Jeff Bezos, along with major players like Nvidia Corp., spearheaded investments in Figure AI Inc., a Sunnyvale-based startup focused on humanoid robot development.\n\nAmid a funding round targeting around $675 million, with an estimated pre-money valuation of $2 billion, Jeff Bezos commits $100 million through Explore Investments LLC. Microsoft invests $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon-affiliated fund contribute $50 million each.\n\nLast year, Parkway Venture Capital led the $70 million initial external funding round for Figure AI, which also included $20 million from the company's CEO and founder Brett Adcock. The ongoing funding round includes investments from Intel Corp.'s venture capital arm, LG Innotek, Samsung's investment group, Parkway Venture Capital, Align Ventures, ARK Venture Fund, Aliya Capital Partners, Tamarack, Boscolo Intervest Ltd., and BOLD Capital Partners.\n\nWhile the final details of the funding round are pending confirmation, these substantial investments underscore the increasing interest in the AI robotics sector. Figure AI focuses on advancing AI technology, concentrating on creating humanoid robots capable of functioning in diverse environments, such as warehouses and retail spaces, and handling hazardous tasks, with support from OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe broader AI robotics industry witnesses significant activity, with companies like 1X Technologies AS and Sanctuary AI securing substantial funds for humanoid robot development. Elon Musk, the company's CEO, is actively developing the humanoid robot Optimus in anticipation of a billion humanoid robots populating the planet by the 2040s, thanks to the expanding potential of AI-powered software to improve robot-human interaction and collaboration.",techtimes.com,news,Tech Times,quincy_jon@techtimes.com,Quincy Jon,author,FALSE,https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/444579/820/0/0/0/covariant.jpg,null,0.3019607843137255,447910636,1

OpenAI reacted to Musk's complaint last week by deriding it in a memo to employees and releasing emails involving him that go back to its earliest days.\n\nMusk, who claimed breach of contract at the startup that he backed, referred in his complaint earlier this month to a 2015 ""founding agreement"" with him and two other OpenAI co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. The three were agreeing that a new AI lab would be a nonprofit for the benefit of humanity and that it would not keep information private for commercial benefit, Musk said.\n\nHe went on to say that in releasing the GPT-4 large language model last year without providing scientific details for public consumption, OpenAI breached that agreement.\n\n""There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear,"" OpenAI said in a document on file with California's superior court for San Francisco County. ""The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him.""\n\nMusk quoted OpenAI's 2015 certificate of incorporation with the Delaware secretary of state, asserting that it ""memorialized"" the founding agreement. But OpenAI responded by saying that Musk's complaint lacked an actual agreement.\n\nThe Microsoft-backed startup called Musk's claims frivolous. But in a Monday blog post it said it was asking the court to designate the case as complex and obtain dedicated case management for it, because it involves AI and its claims go back almost 10 years.\n\nIn his complaint, Musk mentioned that, regarding OpenAI's 2017 plan to establish a for-profit organization, he told Brockman, Altman and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever to ""[e]ither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit.""\n\nOpenAI said in its filing, dated March 6, that if the case were to go to discovery, evidence would show that Musk was on board with the startup gaining for-profit structure.\n\nMusk has his own AI lab called X.AI, which has released a chatbot called Grok that's available through X, formerly known as Twitter, which Musk acquired in 2022. The startup will release Grok's code under an open-source license this week, Musk said in an X post on Monday.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT had 100 million weekly users as of November.\n\n""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" OpenAI said in its filing. ""So he brings this action accusing Defendants of breaching a contract that never existed and duties Musk was never owed, demanding relief calculated to benefit a competitor to OpenAI.""",nbcsandiego.com,news,NBC 7 San Diego,,,,,https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/03/107385929-1710201072107-gettyimages-1852466661-ITALY_MUSK.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,null,0.2078431372549019,447910317,1

And along the way, they amassed staggering fortunes that have disconnected them from reality.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who broke into a sweat during an on-stage interview with Swisher in 2010, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who once talked to her regularly before cutting off communications after he bought Twitter in 2022, are painted in the harshest light.\n\n""If Mark Zuckerberg is the most damaging man in tech to me, Musk was the most disappointing,"" Swisher writes in her 300-page book.\n\nThat's one of the milder critiques in what's a mostly scathing takedown by one of the most respected and feared reporters covering technology. Her reputation is such that Swisher has become as synonymous with Silicon Valley as the famous entrepreneurs who shaped it since she began covering the industry in the 1990s.\n\nCEOs, including Zuckerberg and Musk, regularly granted her exclusive interviews, fed her scoops and sometimes even secretly called her for advice, according to her book. When the HBO series, ""Silicon Valley,"" needed someone to play an influential reporter in an episode, Swisher was cast as herself - a role she still regularly fills as a technology commentator on major TV networks.\n\nSwisher no longer resides in Silicon Valley. She moved to Washington, D.C., a few years ago, mostly because that's where her wife works, but also because she was feeling a need to escape what had become an increasingly toxic and insular scene.\n\nBut she has remained plugged into - and worried - about what is happening with technology, particularly with the accelerating rise of artificial intelligence and its potential for causing even more damage than she thinks has already been done by social media, smartphones and other products that haven't been tightly regulated.\n\nSwisher told The Associated Press that she hopes ""Burn Book"" serves as shot across the bow of both the technology industry and governments around the world, a warning that the same missteps that happened during the past 20 years must not be repeated as artificial intelligence seeps into all corners of society.\n\n""Don't get fooled a second time,"" Swisher said of what she hopes the book's main takeaway will be. ""We need our government to make these (technology-industry) people accountable and that has not happened. We need them to understand consequences because they certainly haven't done us right on the damaging parts of technology. We need to stop letting them off the hook.""\n\nSwisher initially didn't even want to write another book, partly because she has become more interested in focusing on her Pivot podcast. But she but finally got on a roll after she hired Nell Scovell, who co-wrote a best-selling book with former Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, to help her remember all the stories she accumulated.\n\nThose recollections led her to disassemble some of the world's richest people in her book, but Swisher isn't worried about the blowback.\n\n""I don't care what they think,"" Swisher said. ""The worst thing I do is tell people what I think of them, but I am being truthful.""\n\nMusk, who also runs rocket ship maker SpaceX and social media company X, used a pejorative term for anus to describe Swisher in his last email sent to her in October 2022, according to her book.\n\n""You can see it every day on Twitter (renamed X by Musk), there is something wrong with him,"" Swisher said of Musk during the AP interview. ""He is in desperate need of attention, he is a classic narcissist who has turned into a malevolent narcissist.""\n\nSwisher doesn't spend her entire book bashing tech leaders. She devotes an entire chapter to the industry's ""mensches,"" a list that includes Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, investor Mark Cuban and the late Dave Goldberg, who was CEO of SurveyMonkey and Sandberg's husband when he died in 2015 while on vacation in Mexico. She also has mostly kind words for the likes of former Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Apple CEO Tim Cook and his late predecessor, Steve Jobs.\n\nEventually, Swisher said she hopes she will look back kindly on the tech leaders at the vanguard of AI, especially Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the San Francisco startup behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\n""One thing I do like about Sam is he is able to hold two conflicting ideas in his head at the same time,"" Swisher said. ""Of course, he is going to be a techno-optimist, but he is not a techno-idiot. Now what will be a problem is he just takes whatever he wants, even though he has warned of unsafe things, and then does nothing about them.

Through this feature, users are given a 'rider rating' that determines their usage and tracks their impact individually, also using this to nudge customers in the right direction and make more impactful choices in their rides.\n\nDespite lowering an individual's emission rate when using Uber, users may still contribute to pollution unless they opt for EVs in their rides for an almost zero-emission experience.\n\nIn a new press release by Uber, the company introduced the new Emission Savings feature on the app, one that promotes a ""low-emissions lifestyle"" to help make them mindful of their environmental impact. Being mindful of one's surroundings is only a part of this green lifestyle, as users also need to start within themselves to effect this philosophy.\n\nThis feature is made available globally, and it will tell a person how much carbon footprint they contributed with their rides but also focus on the positive impact they have with the use of Uber.\n\nUber will preview several metrics like 'Estimated CO2 savings,' 'Your positive impact,' 'Your eco-friendly rides,' and more.\n\nRead Also: Uber Increases In-App Ads, Prompting Mixed Reactions from Customers\n\nUber said that this feature is similar to the rider rating feature, and this is because this will show how much they helped the environment and reduced carbon footprint through their choice of ride, may it be Uber Green or Uber Comfort Electric.\n\nThe app would also help calculate their emission savings based on the length of their ride and miles traveled. The company also makes this available for teen account holders, rolling out to select cities in the US and Canada.\n\nWhile it is known that Uber is not a car manufacturer, the ride-hailing app still deploys cars with internal combustion engines or hybrids which are still contributors to greenhouse gases and such. However, there were several investments made by Uber, and mostly partnerships, to center on clean energy ventures, with one being its collaboration with Waymo, known for its exclusive use of the Jaguar I-PACE EVs.\n\nAs part of Uber's Climate Pledge for 2040, the company is already investing heavily in clean energy vehicles, centering on its recent partnership for its fleet. The company chose KIA and its PV5 modular electric car for its ride-hailing service, encouraging its drivers to make the switch and use these EVs for their everyday duties in bringing users from point A to B.\n\nAdditionally, Uber also recently partnered up with Elon Musk's Tesla for this massive push towards electrified transportation, relying on its EVs for the service it will render the users.\n\nUber wants you to be conscious of your transportation, especially for its ride-hailing service, offering this Emission Savings feature that offers useful metrics that communicate the carbon footprint caused by one's use of the app's transportation method.",techtimes.com,news,Tech Times,isaiah_richard@techtimes.com,Isaiah Richard,author,FALSE,https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/444580/820/0/0/0/uber-emission-savings.png,eng-9382292,0.223529412,447908285,1

So will they really be free of the grim side-effects which mean so many give up within a year or two? - Today Headline,"Tempted to try Ozempic or Wegovy? These weight-loss wonder drugs are riding a tidal wave of popularity, helped no doubt by celebrity endorsements, with seemingly everyone from Sharon Osbourne to Elon Musk reportedly benefiting from the weekly jabs.\n\nBut both may soon seem old hat, with new drugs around the corner that promise greater weight loss, come in more convenient forms or actually burn off fat while we go about our daily business without even noticing the medications at work -- or suffering side-effects.\n\nLast month both Superdrug and pharmacy service provider Pharmadoctor began privately offering a new weight-loss injection called Mounjaro (generic name tirzepatide), after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nNew drugs are promising greater weight loss than Ozempic and Wegovy. Last month, high street stores and pharmacy service providers started offering new weight-loss injection called Mounjaro... and three other alternatives are now in the pipeline\n\nOther emerging products that may soon become household names are Rybelsus, retatrutide and orforglipron.\n\nAll of these weight-loss drugs work by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone made naturally in the body that helps slow the passage of food through the stomach -- which makes people feel less hungry -- and alters the brain's appetite regulation, so that people feel satiated despite eating less; they also don't experience cravings for treat foods.\n\nRybelsus contains semaglutide, the same drug as in Wegovy and Ozempic (which is a lower dose, originally approved for treating type 2 diabetes), but in daily pill form rather than weekly jab. Similarly, orforglipron is a GLP-1 drug taken daily as a pill.\n\nRetatrutide, given as a weekly injection, is another drug that mimics GLP-1 but it also targets two other hunger hormones, GIP and glucagon.\n\nIn early-stage trials, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, obese people taking retatrutide lost almost a quarter of their body weight in 48 weeks -- outperforming Wegovy, which studies suggest help people to lose an average of 16 per cent of their body weight a year, and even Mounjaro, which may promote 25 per cent body weight loss a year.\n\nOzempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, is already preparing to hit back with another new drug, amycretin. This targets GLP-1 as well as another hormone, called amylin, which also reduces hunger and slows stomach emptying. Early results from the drug's safety trial suggest that amycretin can help users shed weight twice as quickly as Ozempic.\n\nAlso on the horizon are two different new classes of drugs, called controlled metabolic accelerators and thyromimetics. These speed the rate at which we burn up calories -- and thus lose fat (but more on these later).\n\nIt's not difficult to understand why drug companies are pouring into this field. Analysts at Barclays forecast that sales of weight-loss drugs will top £19billion globally this year, with the market growing to £110billion by 2030.\n\nOzempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, is preparing to release anew drug, amycretin. Early results from the drug's safety trial suggest it can help users shed weight twice as quickly as Ozempic\n\nBut the need for something 'better' than GLP-1 drugs has emerged as more and more people try them, because when medications are widely used, significant side-effect problems may fully emerge.\n\nIndeed, mounting evidence suggests that in the real world, the drugs' side-effects such as vomiting and diarrhoea are proving so common and overwhelming that it makes the current versions impractical for most patients to stay on for very long.\n\nThe result is very high patient drop-out rates in real life because of side-effects. As well as vomiting and diarrhoea, the most common adverse effects are nausea, constipation and tiredness.\n\nLess common complications of GLP-1 medications are gallstones, increased heart rate, kidney damage and pancreatitis -- a condition where the pancreas rapidly becomes painfully inflamed.\n\nAnother serious concern is gastroparesis, a severe disorder where the stomach muscles become effectively paralysed and the stomach does not empty, and sufferers vomit days-old food. For some patients, the only remedy for gastroparesis may be a gastric bypass. Around 10,000 patients in the U.S. are now suing Ozempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, and Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, for medical-injury damages.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it believed the claims are without merit; Eli Lilly said it will 'vigorously defend against these claims'.\n\nDespite side-effects now coming to light, there were no apparent high drop-out rates among patients using GLP-1 drugs in clinical trials, which were funded by the drugs' makers. Novo Nordisk reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year how its trial of 17,000 people taking semaglutide found that intolerable side-effects caused only one in six patients to stop taking it. But in the real world of patients taking GLP-1 drugs outside of carefully controlled clinical trials, the drop-out figures are significantly higher.\n\nFor example, a study in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care in 2022, which looked at health records of 589 Britons who had been prescribed GLP-1 medications for type 2 diabetes, reported the patient drop-out rates were 45 per cent after one year and 65 per cent at two years.\n\nThe researchers, funded by the drugs giant Merck (which is developing its own GLP-1 drug, efinopegdutide), warned that their study results 'suggest the real-world benefit of these agents on weight loss may be lower than that observed in clinical trials'.\n\nWorse drop-out rates were revealed in July last year by U.S. analysts, Prime Therapeutics. In an analysis of data from over 4,000 people prescribed GLP-1 drugs, it found that more than two-thirds of patients stopped taking them within a year.\n\nOnce a patient drops out of the regimen, most of their weight returns, along with related risks for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, chronic body-wide inflammation and problems with insulin control, according to another study, by Aintree University Hospital in 2022.\n\nAround 10,000 patients in the U.S. are now suing Novo Nordisk which makes Ozempic, pictured, and Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, for medical-injury damages\n\nThe researchers studied around 1,900 people who had received GLP-1 injections for more than a year and found that 12 months after they stopped the therapy, they had regained on average two-thirds of whatever weight they'd lost while on the drug.\n\nMeanwhile, longer-term side-effects are also emerging. One concern is muscle loss: trials of GLP-1 drugs show roughly 40 per cent of the weight lost is muscle mass rather than fat.\n\nThis can have serious health implications. Not only do you need muscle to burn calories but, for example, in middle-aged and older people, muscle loss (called sarcopenia) is strongly associated with frailty and early death.\n\nEli Lilly is collaborating with a California-based biotech firm, BioAge Labs, to develop a compound called azelaprag that may preserve muscle.\n\nThis drug mimics apelin, a hormone released during exercise that improves muscle function. It needs to pass safety and effectiveness trials in humans, so would not be available for some years.\n\nBut in the meantime, such is the concern about side-effects that in January, Eli Lilly published an open letter urging people not to use Mounjaro for cosmetic weight loss, and instead to take it only for serious medical needs such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt warned that 'Mounjaro should only be used when prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional', and said that it 'may cause tumours in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer', and 'serious side-effects, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)'.\n\nNaveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, told Good Health that he believes some of the side-effects occur because patients aren't changing their lifestyles to accommodate the GLP-1 medications.\n\n'If you're taking a drug that suppresses your appetite and slows the pace at which your stomach empties, then it's going to make you eat less and more slowly, and also to eat less foods that irritate the stomach such as spicy and fatty ones,' he says.\n\n'If people don't accordingly change their habits quickly enough, they'll have problems.'\n\nWe know that compliance is very low with people taking any drug long-term, even when it's for something serious such as diabetes or cancer\n\nProfessor Sattar, who has consulted for several companies that make weight-loss drugs, stresses: 'Some people can quickly make changes and significantly mitigate their risk of side-effects, by doing things such as slowly eating portions that are smaller and low in fat, and stopping eating when they feel satiated.'\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that others will suffer problems through adverse physical reactions to the medication.\n\n'It may be that some individuals' stomach tissue is hypersensitive to the drugs, so they will naturally have a problem,' he says.\n\n'But with an increasing range of GLP-1 drugs coming on to the market, I think people will find that if one medication doesn't work, another will.\n\n'All the time, doctors and patients are learning how to use these drugs better, so I think we will see the incidence of side-effects reducing significantly.'\n\nOthers are not so convinced.\n\nAs Ahmed Ahmed, a consultant bariatric surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London, says: 'Unrealistic expectations of a weight-loss cure have been driven by social media, not science or medicine, and by marketing rather than public health.\n\n'This has created some serious misconceptions: these drugs can certainly work, but clinical trials show that around a third of people don't respond to GLP-1 drugs [see case study, right].\n\n'People also think that they will end up at their ideal weight, but most just don't lose that much.\n\n'Worse, they think you can take the drug for only a short while and keep the weight off permanently afterwards, but all the research shows that this isn't true: people put the weight back on after stopping the drug.'\n\nBut does the answer lie elsewhere? There are new classes of weight-loss medications on the horizon that act differently from the GLP-1 drugs -- and so may avoid some of their side-effects.\n\nOne of these classes of medication is called controlled metabolic accelerators (CMAs).\n\nThese speed up metabolism by harnessing a natural process in mitochondria, the 'batteries' inside all our cells, to boost the way our bodies break down fat and sugar, and also to raise the amount of energy our bodies burn while they are resting.\n\nIt's a bit like turning up our bodies' internal thermostats so that we burn more calories all the time, thus losing weight.\n\nExcept that CMAs don't raise your body's temperature, according to trials of the first example -- a daily pill called HU6 being developed by the U.S. firm Rivus Pharmaceuticals.\n\nLast December, in the journal The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology, the company published results of a preliminary 61-day trial on 80 adults, which reported that HU6 successfully reduced the volunteers' body weight, with no loss of muscle, and at the same time improved measures of metabolism such as insulin control and reduced levels of body-wide inflammation.\n\nSide-effects were flushing, which a third of participants experienced; diarrhoea, which a quarter reported; and palpitations, which affected around one in ten. None of the volunteers suffered nausea or vomiting (as is a common problem in patients taking GLP-1 drugs). Accelerating people's metabolisms for weight loss is an idea proposed back in 2001 by researchers at the independent Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California.\n\nThe problem back then was that the only known CMA drug candidate was one called 2,4-dinitrophenol -- which is effective, but also potentially lethal.\n\nLast year, a Scottish court heard how 2,4-dinitrophenol had killed at least 33 people in the UK, mostly bodybuilders, who used it illegally to strip fat and achieve the coveted 'ripped effect'.\n\nJamie George, a gym owner who had been making the drug in his home and selling it globally for four years, was sentenced to 37 months in prison after pleading guilty to supplying a dangerous substance.\n\nThe court heard expert evidence that the drug carries a high risk of severe toxicity, and can cause kidney failure, liver failure and cardiac arrest, even at low doses.The maker of HU6, however, said it has engineered its CMA drug to be free of any such dangers. It is now undergoing further safety trials to establish its effectiveness at treating the obesity-related conditions type 2 diabetes and heart failure.\n\nAnother approach showing promise involves using drugs (known as thyromimetics) to boost the activity of our thyroid hormones, which in turn may boost our metabolic rates; in turn, we would shed weight by burning off more calories.\n\nThis simple-sounding approach is complicated by the side-effects. As a 2009 review in the journal Hepatology cautioned: 'An excess of thyroid hormone is associated with unwanted effects, particularly on the heart (including sudden death).'\n\nScientists have since been busily attempting to create thyroid hormone-boosting drugs that are free of such alarming\n\nrisks. Last year, researchers at the University of Massachusetts announced that they had developed a thyroid-boosting drug that, in lab studies, had dramatically reduced weight in obese mice without 'any untoward side-effects'.\n\nWriting in the journal PNAS Nexus, they reported that after five weeks of treatment, the mice's weight dropped to a healthy normal, even though they were still eating the same high-fat diet that had caused them to pile on weight beforehand. Their levels of cholesterol and inflammation also dropped.\n\nThe treatment has one significant drawback: it is delivered directly into the liver by daily injection.\n\nThe researchers said that if the drug was not delivered selectively to the liver, it could 'cause complications' around the rest of the body.\n\nBut while there is still considerable work still to be done, the researchers hope to develop their innovation into a practical weight-loss drug.\n\nProfessor Sattar says: 'These new drug approaches may offer a way of getting around the side-effects of GLP-1 drugs. However, they are still some way away from being approved for clinical use.\n\n'The GLP-1 drugs are not a cure for all the nation's weight issues, but they are here now. We must learn better how to mitigate their side-effects.'\n\nFor surgeon Mr Ahmed, this raises concerns about other effects of these medications.\n\n'These drugs are still quite new and we only have three or four years' worth of evidence. I worry that after ten years of taking the drugs people may develop very serious physical side-effects. We just don't know yet,' he says.\n\n'As for other types of new drugs that speed the metabolism, we just don't know whether they will work and there is certainly a risk of serious side-effects such as heart damage here.'\n\nThere is also the issue common to all drug treatments -- people taking such medication long-term.\n\nMr Ahmed says: 'We know that compliance is very low with people taking any drug long-term, even when it's for something serious such as diabetes or cancer.\n\n'People just aren't good at taking drugs for long periods.'",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,kathy_d_woodward@todayheadline.co,Kathy D.

Although Musk helped found OpenAI with Sam Altman, staying with the company until 2018, then departing after disagreements about the future direction of the company.\n\nMore recently, Musk has criticized OpenAI over its partnership with Microsoft and other funding sources, both making the products private, non-open-source softwares, and making the company officially for-profit. Musk also announced plans to sue OpenAI and Sam Altman earlier this month, and on Monday, the entrepreneur put his money where his mouth is by announcing xAI's plans to open-source Grok as soon as this week.\n\nBefore xAI, Elon Musk had hopes for OpenAI at Tesla\n\nThe software becoming open-source means that its source code will become publicly available to modify and re-share, which is something that Musk has increasingly expressed as being important in the past few years. Other companies such as Meta and Mistral also offer open-source AI language models.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI shared a blog post last week saying that Musk had already agreed upon moving to a for-profit model in 2015, and even going on to share a series of email exchanges between 2015 and 2016. The post also says that Musk forwarded OpenAI leadership an email indicating that the AI company should ""attach to Tesla as its cash cow,"" in early 2018.\n\n""We need to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending,"" Musk wrote in another email in 2015. ""I think we should say that we are starting with a $1B funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.""\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. In this scam, TikTok, YouTube or Instagram users are lured into entering promo codes 'CODE29' on Albidex.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account.\n\nBut when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Albidex.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Albidex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Albidex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Albidex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nAlbidex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Albidex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Albidex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Albidex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Albidex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nAlbidex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Albidex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Albidex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Albidex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Albidex.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Albidex.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table.\n\nWhat to Do If Scammed 😱\n\nIf you've fallen prey to the Albidex.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims. Here's a concise list of steps you should take right away:\n\n🛑 Stop All Deposits and Sharing of Personal Info\n\nCease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website.\n\n🏦 Contact Your Bank Immediately\n\nNotify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Albidex.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nThe Albidex.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡",myantispyware.com,news,My AntiSpyware,,,,,https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Albidex.com-WHOIS-Lookup.png,null,-0.450980392,447907852,6

Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp., its largest investor.\n\nIn the filing, OpenAI stresses that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because ""there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear."" OpenAI also denied Musk's claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.\n\n""The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,"" OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. ""Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganize and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.""\n\nOpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicized battle since well before the court case. Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. Musk has criticized OpenAI for its commercialization strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft.\n\nIn its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc., his car company. It also said in the filing that Musk was in favor of OpenAI operating as a for-profit company, but only if he controlled it. ""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the company's lawyers wrote.\n\nMusk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe dispute between two of tech's biggest players touches on core issues of AI safety and accessibility, and has spilled over into the larger startup world. On Monday, billionaire venture capitalist and OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla told Bloomberg TV that Musk could not sue his way to artificial general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI also argues in the filing that if pretrial fact-finding and information sharing known as discovery begins in the case, Musk would use the suit to get access to OpenAI's ""proprietary records and technology,"" and warned that demands for discovery ""would need to be carefully policed.""\n\nOpenAI also asked that the court designate the suit a ""complex case,"" which under California rules is a meant to avoid making the case unnecessarily burdensome for the court and the parties involved.

This certainly wasn't going to be a discussion about underground train systems in LA and missions to Mars ala Elon Musk's chat with Jonathan Nolan back at SXSW 2018.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nHowever, Althoff warmed up as she sat on stage with L'Oreal's CeraVe SVP & Global Head of Digital Marketing, Adam Kornblum, and Chief Digital & Marketing Officer Han Wen. For it finally became revealed how the Aubrey Plaza-type personality became a lynchpin in the grand master marketing plan of the beauty conglom leading up to Super Bowl Sunday with their CeraVe product.\n\nIn sum, Althoff in her Jan. 25 sit down with Michael Cera was an essential component in spreading the intriguing viral narrative that the Barbie actor was the architect of the CeraVe beauty line.\n\nTruth is, he's not. But, boy, did the product's profile get raised from the ruse. L'Oreal bought the CeraVe brand in 2017. The advanced skincare product line was founded in 2005.\n\nThe whole social media sensation with CeraVe began back in January 2020 when filmmaker Tyler Perry made a comment online about needing skin moisturizer. Tom Allison, founder of CeraVe, responded by offering to Perry the product. Allison's tweet to Perry racked up 30,7K likes and close to 2k retweets. Perry wound up take a selfie with the skin product.\n\n""It was a big moment,"" said Kornblum, ""Each day we try to crack the culture.""\n\nIn re-igniting CeraVe this year, Kornblum told the JW Marriot room in Austin, TX that a brief was sent to the beauty company's ad agency ""to create an immersive story. We wanted to do in phases all over digital and social touch points. Then we have this Super Bowl spot. We needed a 360-degree world, how to order codes and dominate culture.""\n\nTheir CeraVe campaign rolled out in three phases.\n\nPhase one: the fake news about Michael Cera developing the brand.\n\nDetailed Kornblum, ""Enter Bobbi who interviews Michael and seriously and directly asks him (about creating CeraVe). He couldn't answer, he just said 'He had skin in the game.'""\n\nIt was a massive moment that went viral sans paid media, discreetly labeled as ""#ad"" in Althoff's post.\n\nPhase 2: There's a public backlash with dermatologists associated with the brand exclaiming how Cera ""doesn't sign our checks."" That phase lasted two weeks.\n\nPhase 3 was the actual Super Bowl ad for CeraVe starring Cera in which he sarcastically says he's the maestro behind the creme. The ad ends with the pull of the curtain and we learn it was all a joke.\n\nBefore the ad dropped, the L'Oreal marketing team had racked up some 9 billion impressions across social and digital about the CeraVe product.\n\nThe upfront strategy relied heavily on PR spurred by Althoff, memes, various news breaks to create ""an organic and earned approach"" per Kornblum. ""We had everyone working -social media influencers from digital to email to SMS; every day was a real-time command center.""\n\nWen added that it was important in the campaign that ""if everything isn't going well, we'd be able to pivot and take punches.""\n\nAlthoff was shameless in her involvement: ""Um, I got an email from my agent at WME, and they were like do you want to work with CeraVe. I clicked it. I looked at the number. I was like 'I'm intrigued' and I said 'yes' before reading the brief.""\n\n""Then I read the brief with my little sister, and said ""Oh my God, Lexi, did you know Michael Cera made CeraVe? She was like 'I had no idea.' We aren't good at reading very well.""\n\nAlthoff received an all-expense paid trip to New York. ""It was the most exciting day of my career. It was like a real film set-up. My podcast is done so crappy,"" she confessed. L'Oreal's team of videographers worked with her Althoff's editors, the influencer having a big say in the creative.\n\nThe appeal of Althoff to L'Oreal was her authenticity. Wen recalled the moment when she met Althoff who shared quite sincerely that the twentysomething named her daughter 'Richard.' Althoff went in that direction, because she wanted to have a boy.\n\n""What resonated with me was that's actually something that everyone can resonate with; it's so hard to script and it's all genuine,"" said Wen.\n\nAlthoff says her personal secret to success stems from working with brands ""that I use in my day-to-day life.""\n\n""It's easier to let viewers know when I'm not lying about something,"" Althoff said.\n\nShe said she wrote a list of ""every brand I use in my day-to-day life and have my agent reach out to them."" CeraVe was a product she use to get samples of from her dermatologist when she was treating her acne back in high school.\n\nEmphasized Althoff, ""I lean into every brand I work with -- I get paid, they get people to buy their product.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,,,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2krUiJNezgShLBHjSjdnDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deadline.com/061f259bede2312bc3d87700e9371852,null,0.2078431372549019,447905864,1

The conversations centered around the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which Ramswamy opposes. He highlighted the potential harm this could cause Trump.

According to Trump, the last pair of shoes, which was a special edition, sold for $450,000. ""People were going crazy for these sneakers. You probably were too.

The blog post included emails that Musk had previously sent to other OpenAI cofounders, including one from 2018 in which Musk told company executives that OpenAI should sell itself to Tesla to remain competitive. The company refused, and Musk left OpenAI later that year.\n\nOpenAI's court filing goes even further, accusing Musk of conjuring the supposed founding agreement to form the basis of a lawsuit designed to ""advance his own commercial interests."" It claims that OpenAI did not have a founding agreement or any other agreement with Musk related to his funding of the company.\n\n""Were this case to proceed to discovery, the evidence would show that Musk supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI, to be controlled by Musk himself, and dropped the project when his wishes were not followed. Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the filing states.\n\nThe filing asks a judge to designate the case as ""complex,"" which would, among other things, create some guardrails for the discovery process. OpenAI also said it believes that ""early and swift dismissal"" of Musk's suit is warranted.\n\nOpenAI is concerned that Musk could use the discovery process to ""seek access to OpenAI's proprietary records and technology,"" according to the filing.\n\nMusk is now running his own artificial intelligence company, XAI, which seeks to compete with OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI argues that Musk's demand for relief -- which includes a request to order OpenAI to make all of its technology and research available to the public -- is ""extraordinary"" and would ""benefit Musk, whose own for-profit AI concern has not met with success in the marketplace.""\n\nLawyers for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",aol.com,news,Aol,clare_duffy@aol.com,Clare Duffy,author,FALSE,https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_business_articles_764/f653e14b5c4c08ae66097c9af886e554,null,-0.003921569,447905749,4

That moment came with a succulent and explosive revelation:\n\nChatGPT At some point it would merge with Tesla Motors in a clear attempt to acquire an asset with greater project potential for the benefit of another company it owns.\n\nThis revelation brings a new nuance to this discussion, explaining why Elon Musk adopted this attitude against the organization he once defended.\n\nA movement that praises everything, OpenAI published a series of private emails from Elon Musk, co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence company, revealing both his intentions and his position on the future of OpenAI.\n\nThe emails, disclosed in an extensive blog postWe directly and practically irrefutably contradict Musk's recent criticism of the organization and expõem of his past interest in hiring OpenAI as ChatGPT within the Tesla Motors.\n\nThe emails showed that Musk wanted OpenAI to be merged with Tesla or to have full control of the company in all of its projects, including the chatbot that we all know now.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, it is incompatible with its mission to create safe and beneficial Artificial Intelligence for humanity. Therefore, the company argues that Musk only processed OpenAI when it ""started to make significant progress"" in the direction of its original objective, but without it being more involved in the organization.\n\nMost contrasting to all this new evidence is that, contrary to his current criticisms, the emails indicate that Musk initially supported the move by OpenAI to a for-profit model.\n\nIn a message from 2016, he responded ""just like"" to a proposal that the company become ""less open"" in the future.\n\nLater, in January 2018, Musk suggested that Tesla become a ""cash cow"" for OpenAI.\n\nBased on the argument that Tesla was the only company with which OpenAI could compete against Google, it was confirmed that the chances of success were small.\n\nLater, in February 2018, Musk decided to leave OpenAI and ended up founding his own general intelligence company, xAI Corp.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, Musk mentioned that the company has 0% chance of being relevant without a significant change in the execution of our resources.\n\nToday we see that everything has changed, now that OpenAI has financial support from Microsoft.\n\nHowever, the future of OpenAI is still uncertain, but the publication of these emails provides a new perspective on what Elon Musk is driving.",bullfrag.com,news,Bullfrag,jaxon_miles@bullfrag.com,Jaxon Miles,author,FALSE,https://www.fayerwayer.com/resizer/HSydKX_HDS2TUGPOJa6KN6CcSUA=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/metroworldnews/YAN2FJ4WK5G3THHRNZNL3M3S6Y.webp,eng-9383543,0.1137254901960785,447905725,9

Trump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organisations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The donations which were fully permitted under campaign finance law went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations. TikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the US, most of whom skew younger a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television. Biden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban. The bill passed unanimously by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a US ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House. As president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) a threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States. The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights. Pressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\nBut,"" he went on to say, you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too."" Some American companies, he charged, are not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.""\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes. He also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls countries of concern, including China. Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The US government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening. Trump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,"" he wrote.

Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp., its largest investor.\n\nIn the filing, OpenAI stresses that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because ""there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear."" OpenAI also denied Musk's claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.\n\n""The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,"" OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. ""Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganise and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.""\n\nOpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicised battle since well before the court case. Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. Musk has criticised OpenAI for its commercialisation strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft.\n\nIn its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc., his car company. It also said in the filing that Musk was in favor of OpenAI operating as a for-profit company, but only if he controlled it. ""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the company's lawyers wrote.\n\nMusk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe dispute between two of tech's biggest players touches on core issues of AI safety and accessibility, and has spilled over into the larger startup world. On Monday, billionaire venture capitalist and OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla told Bloomberg TV that Musk could not sue his way to artificial general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI also argues in the filing that if pretrial fact-finding and information sharing known as discovery begins in the case, Musk would use the suit to get access to OpenAI's ""proprietary records and technology,"" and warned that demands for discovery ""would need to be carefully policed.""\n\nOpenAI also asked that the court designate the suit a ""complex case,"" which under California rules is a meant to avoid making the case unnecessarily burdensome for the court and the parties involved. Cases are typically deemed complex and assigned to specially designated judges when they involve complicated and technical issues, as well as multiple parties and numerous claims.",business-standard.com,news,Business Standard,,,,,https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-03/12/full/1710207590-0535.jpg,eng-9383543,-0.098039216,447905436,1

The move was seen as a direct challenge to ChatGPT-parent OpenAI, a company that the tech mogul co-founded in 2015 and left in 2018.\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nNow, Deepwater Asset Management's managing partner, Gene Munster, has shared his thoughts on Musk's announcement.

""Musk reports that xAI has not and is not raising money, but I believe that will soon change because speed and deep pockets are paramount in the AI race,"" he said, adding, ""When it does, he's going to raise boat loads of money fast.""\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier in February, Munster had predicted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X, would boost the value of his AI company xAI.\n\n""The reason is Twitter's data is powerful (best source of real time intention), and he'll use the data to train xAI to be a top three Foundation Model,"" he said at the time, adding, ""Those models should be valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars.""\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Google CEO's Anxiety Exposed?

But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press staff writers Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",charlotteobserver.com,news,The Charlotte Observer,kevin_freking@charlotteobserver.com,Kevin Freking,author,FALSE,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/wps/build/images/charlotteobserver/facebook.jpg,null,0.066666667,447904676,1

New technologies are supercharging online disinformation, which as we know, quickly turns into real-life conflict. At the same time, laws and regulations around speech and online content are stuck in the past century. On this week's Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Barbara McQuade, former federal prosecutor and author of Attack From Within: How Disinformation Is Sabotaging America, to discuss whether and how the courts might handle a dizzying array of new threats to election integrity from social media and disinformation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: The United States is uniquely susceptible [to disinformation] in part because of the First Amendment, in part because of a legal regime under which we operate, and this notion that for better or for worse, the marketplace of ideas is the way to go. You talk about how corrupt and corruptible the marketplace of ideas is. But I find myself struck by the twin facts that we have archaic doctrine that cannot possibly metabolize technological change fast enough, and then we also have these archaic ideas about how a marketplace of ideas could work. Do you mind just thinking through the ways in which it's almost overdetermined that we can't get control of this because of the constraints of the First Amendment?\n\nBarbara McQuade: I think we can, but I do think that it makes it really challenging. We all cherish the First Amendment; people on the left, on the right, and in between. Everybody understands why the First Amendment is so important. And so it makes it difficult to say ""We're going to ban disinformation,"" because who is the arbiter of what is disinformation and what is not? But we need to rethink social media and whether it's completely hands-off. As you well know, no right is absolute, including our First Amendment rights to free speech. As long as there is satisfaction of strict scrutiny -- that is, a compelling governmental interest and a limitation that is narrowly tailored to achieve -- that interest does pass constitutional muster.\n\nSo I think we need to think about that online. People refer to social media as the virtual town square. Elon Musk loves to say that this is the modern town square. But it's really different from the town square, right? It's very different from a real person standing on a soap box in the town square. In the town square, we can see who's speaking. Is it really a Black activist or is it a Russian guy in a hoodie? We can assess their credibility based on who it is. We can also see how other members of the public are responding. Are people cheering? Are they booing? Are they just walking by and ignoring this person?\n\nWhereas online, people get likes and shares that may be generated by bots. It might be controlled by the speaker themselves, but we don't know that. So they can create the illusion of popularity when it may be that no real people are liking and sharing that message at all. So the parallels don't work the way they do in real life. But I do think that we can regulate social media even without addressing content, and that might be the way to do it. Content-based regulation is where you get into trouble with the First Amendment.\n\nBut there are other things we could do -- like regulating the algorithms, the computer code that tells programs what to do. A couple of years ago, there was this Facebook whistleblower named Frances Haugen. She was a data scientist at Facebook and she disclosed that Facebook was designing algorithms to deliberately generate outrage. Because if you were outraged, you were more likely to stay online. More eyeballs would be on the ads, and the platform would make more money. So people were being manipulated so that Facebook could turn a profit. You know the old phrase, ""If you don't know what the product is, it's probably you""? Turns out it was true at Facebook. So we could have regulations that say that algorithms may not be used to manipulate people to generate outrage, or at least require disclosure of those algorithms, so that people would know which platforms are trying to use them to generate outrage.\n\nThe other thing that these social media companies do is they microtarget people to the most minute degree such that they know what messages are going to resonate with you. So I've been shopping for winter boots and suddenly I see ads for winter boots everywhere. Wow. How did they know? Well, they know because of my search history and because of the things I'm clicking on and what I'm communicating with, but they know, down to every detail, everything there is to know about us. And so we get bombarded with certain messages that only we see and maybe other people aren't seeing. And when you and I are not seeing messages other people are seeing, it's very difficult for us to rebut them. Only people in certain echo chambers are hearing certain messages about ""2000 mules,"" or whatever the allegation of the day is, and it's difficult for the rest of society to rebut that the way we could if it were out there in the public domain.\n\nAnd so perhaps disclosing some of the ways groups are being microtargeted, which microgroup we are in, how we're being sorted, we could require disclosure of all of those things.\n\nI want to ask you, because you're so steeped in these questions of data privacy and national security and technology, what you made of oral arguments in these content moderation cases. I'm trying to be generous when I say that you have a Supreme Court who's just in this complete mashup of technology they don't fully understand. They're searching for a metaphor: Is it a publisher or is it a phone company? [What should they do with] Section 230? There's so many pieces of this, and all due respect to the court, they never cover themselves in glory when they do these technology cases.\n\nI think it was Justice Kagan herself who said last term, talking about some of these cases, that the last people you want deciding these issues is nine people in black robes, because we don't get it, we don't understand any of this. It is a challenge as technology becomes more complicated. I know I've talked to a judge who served on the FISA court, where the technology that they're dealing with now for surveillance techniques has become so complicated that they need technical amici to help explain how the systems work.\n\nYou're talking about the two Netchoice cases, Netchoice v. Paxton and Moody v. Netchoice, that are challenging these laws passed in Texas and Florida that would say it is illegal for social media platforms to remove content that violates their community standards. It's really interesting because each side is sort of accusing the other of violating their free speech rights. The states say that the social media platforms are engaging in censorship when they take content down, and the social media platforms are saying, ""You are violating our First Amendment rights by forcing us to say things that violate our terms of service. We don't want bullying and harassment and threats on our platforms because our business model is all about having a safe space for conversation. And you know, sometimes people are a little bit provocative, but we wanna take down anything that might be hurtful or dangerous."" And so it's this First Amendment faceoff. ""No, you're violating my First Amendment rights."" ""No, you're violating my First Amendment rights!""\n\nThere were two justices -- no surprise, I suppose -- Thomas and Alito, who actually did say: How is what you're doing anything but censorship? So, they seem to have their minds made up [as to] who was violating the First Amendment.\n\nBut it seems to me social media platforms are private actors. I don't see how they can possibly violate anyone's First Amendment rights and engage in censorship that would violate the First Amendment, because they're not state actors. They're private entities, so I think they get to decide what goes on their platforms and what doesn't. So I think they're going to win these cases.\n\nIt does raise a bigger issue, though, of how to think about social media platforms. On the one hand, they want to say, ""We're publishers and we should enjoy the same editorial discretion that the New York Times enjoys."" On the other hand, they say, ""But we're not publishers when it comes to defamation laws, because there we get this immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. We're just a platform! We're like the soap box in the town square, we're not involved in content in any way, we just provide this place where people can come and talk."" So it kind of seems they want to have it both ways.\n\nAt some point we have to adjust the way we think about social media platforms. They don't really fit squarely into any category, so I think we need to think carefully. We're probably overdue for some adjustments to Section 230. I don't know exactly what that might look like, but it does feel like a little bit of a square peg in a round hole the way we're trying to deal with it right now.\n\nAnd then we've got this other case coming down the pike in the Murthy case -- about whether the Biden administration violated the First Amendment when it asked social media companies to consider removing certain content that was dangerous to public safety, about COVID remedies and other kinds of things.\n\nI suspect that their ability to jawbone with social media companies should remain permissible. But that is a concern too. How heavy-handed can they be in telling social media companies what they can and cannot post? I think as long as it's a request and not a demand, it should be OK. But we're really struggling with figuring out how we deal with this huge part of our lives that doesn't really fit any of our traditional ideas of how speech works.",slate.com,news,Slate Magazine,dahlia_lithwick@slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,author,FALSE,https://compote.slate.com/images/bfd37dd4-21db-4ebf-9349-39cb3344acfb.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,eng-9383726,0.019607843,447884099,1

Psychedelics can help with the kind of divergent, creative thinking that's more required now,"" says Paul Austin, a lanky, bearded 33-year-old ""microdosing coach"" and founder of Third Wave, which offers courses costing as much as $14,000 to certify psychedelic guides.\n\nThere are new concerns about the credibility of scientific research on psychedelics, and about the effects of daytime dosing in the workplace. Still, drugs like psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, and MDMA, or ecstasy, are stirring widespread optimism in some quarters. They're believed to open people up to new ideas or change, a big draw for coaches.\n\nSome coaches work openly at resorts in countries like Jamaica that haven't outlawed the drugs, while others operate quietly out of private homes or Airbnbs in the U.S., where such drugs are federally illegal but authorities largely look the other way. They cater to a rise in popular interest, and often the particular yearnings of ambitious hedge fund principals, entrepreneurs or executives.\n\n""I believe psilocybin helps me be a better me, and therefore helps me be a better leader,"" says Jim MacPhee, a 66-year-old leadership consultant who retired as chief operating officer of Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World in 2021. He doesn't encourage his clients to use drugs, or endorse illegal or recreational use, but says his own two experiences during retirement at an overseas retreat have helped him be more ""dialed in"" to his consulting work.\n\nThe reported drug use of Elon Musk, Sergey Brin and the murdered Cash App executive Bob Lee has brought fresh attention to how the business world is affected by rising use of psychedelics. Common concerns like hyper-suggestibility and changes to the brain's executive function are amplified when it comes to those in positions of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""They make you more vulnerable and suggestible to others,"" says Sandra Dreisbach, a co-founder of Ethical Psychedelic International Community, which encourages integrity among people who work with the drugs. ""Meanwhile, you're more prone to making large significant changes. People can be inclined to quit their job, leave their significant other, or make huge shifts of lifestyle."" She advises anyone to wait a week, or even months, after a psychedelic experience before making major decisions.\n\nEven in traditional financial circles, coaches are finding eager clients. At a ""ketitation"" circle that combined ketamine and meditation in New York last fall, a 56-year-old co-founder of a hedge fund who would only give his name as Joseph sat on the floor of a softly lit loft and listened to session leader Zappy Zapolin. Zapolin touted his past roles at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns before he became a psychedelic ""concierge"" to celebrities, and then the business world.\n\n""This is all about peak performance,"" Zapolin told Joseph and a couple dozen other people, before a light session of Qi Gong movement exercises, acupuncture and ketamine lozenges - plus a spit cup for the heavy salivation they induce.\n\nJoseph said he first tried intravenous-drip ketamine for work stress and depression at a clinic in early 2023, when his fund's performance was weak. ""It helped me to change my mindset and realize that my life isn't tied to my P&L,"" he said, referring to profit-and-loss statements.\n\nRISKS ABOUND\n\nPsychedelic use comes with risks, like lasting perceptual distortions or a sense of detachment from reality, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In California, hospital visits related to hallucinogens rose 54% from 2016 to 2022, according to recent research. Decriminalization hasn't done away with legal risk, either: US seizures of psilocybin soared 247% from 2017 to 2022, a study earlier this year reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin's Third Wave has trained around 200 psychedelic guides since 2021, around a fifth of them executive coaches. At a retreat last fall in the mountains of Colorado, which has decriminalized psychedelic drugs, Austin led ""Psychedelic Trailblazers Mastermind,"" a $3,500-a-head weekend attended by many of Third Wave's students that featured breathwork, intimacy-inducing eye-gazing exercises and lectures - all leading up to a group trip on one of the most powerful strains of psilocybin, Ghost.\n\nOne attendee, Michael, who asked to be identified by his first name only, works in Chicago, where corporate clients pay for his traditional executive coaching sessions. But he's also done underground ceremonies in private homes using MDMA, or ecstasy, and psilocybin. The drugs clear a person's ego out of the way, he said. ""With psychedelics, people are cracked right open.""\n\nMichael, like five other coaches who work with psychedelics interviewed for this story, declined to go into more detail, citing client confidentiality and their own legal risks. Many said they worked with another person who served the actual drugs.\n\nOne coach, Lauren Mugglebee, told a group at Mastermind that she uses vape-pen-type devices with graduated doses of inhalable ""jaguar,"" a synthetic version of the toad-venom derivative 5-MeO-DMT. Known as the ""business trip"" for its short duration, the drug is also called the ""God molecule"" for its powerful effects. It's ripe for abuse, she said, but effective: ""I'm a coach, not a therapist. I'm looking for things to act as a catalyst.""\n\nOMAN, BAHRAIN\n\nRonen Aires, a member of Entrepreneurs' Organization, a group for entrepreneurs who own companies generating at least $1 million in annual revenue, said he's given recent talks on psychedelics to EO groups in Oman and Bahrain. Another EO member and executive coach who helps clients with psychedelics, Mark Worster, said he's spoken on psychedelic use with 18 EO chapters in India, four in the US and one in Nepal. By the time he's finished a tour of India this spring, he estimates he will have reached around 1,000 EO members. An EO spokeswoman said the organization doesn't have a position, official or otherwise, on members' potential use of psychedelics in business.\n\nThe mix of drugs and Type-A personalities can create its own pitfalls, with entrepreneurs potentially going overboard and wanting to roll their own psychedelic experience out at scale. Adding executive coaches to the mix makes it even more potent.\n\n""Coaches are all about 'find your passion and your cosmic why,'"" said Jules Evans, who runs the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project, a nonprofit that studies difficult experiences on the drugs. ""That, combined with these strong imperatives where people seem to get messages from the drug itself, can lead people down blind alleys,"" he said. ""They can be told to build arks, or invest all their money in psychedelics or crypto.""\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Before starting to invest his funds through his family hedge fund, Duquesne Family Office, he closely worked with George Soros and played a pivotal role in Soros' bet against the pound, raking in approximately $1 billion in total profits back in 1992.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Druckenmiller holds 50 stocks in his portfolio, valued at roughly $3.11 billion. In the last quarter of 2023, Duquesne Family Office's portfolio value rose by 2.1%. Over a third of Druckenmiller's total portfolio is invested in just three large-cap stocks.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT is one of the most promising tech giants, as the company's strategic investments in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming are paying off. The company has a sizable stake in the viral generative AI platform ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which generated $1.6 billion in annual revenues in 2023, less than a year since its launch. OpenAI is poised to generate $2 billion in annualized revenues.\n\nShares of MSFT have surged by over 10% so far this year, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's 7.9% gains over this period. Druckenmiller holds approximately 1.1 million of MSFT stock (as of December 31), accounting for roughly 13.1% of his total portfolio.\n\nThe company also invested 15 million euros in French startup Mistral AI, which is widely regarded as a major competitor to OpenAI. While the investment is currently under scrutiny from the European Union because of potential antitrust practices, the stake in Mistral AI could pivot Microsoft to become the biggest player in the generative AI space.\n\nStart generating passive income through real estate\n\nCheck out these featured investments from Benzinga's Real Estate Offerings Screener.\n\nAustin CityfundNadaMin.

The billionaire investor owns approximately 22.91 million shares of CPNG through the Duquesne Family Office, accounting for 11.93% of his total portfolio. CPNG stock increased by over 16% so far this year.\n\nThe company's strong financials, despite macroeconomic headwinds, make it a promising retail stock, as Barclays analyst John Shao issued an Overweight rating on Coupang. Shao also issued a price target of $25 on the stock, indicating a potential upside of over 32%. Deutsche Bank analyst Peter Milliken also issued a Buy rating on CPNG stock last month with a price target of $21, indicating a potential upside of over 11%.\n\n""Our accelerating growth in revenues, active customers and WOW members reflect our unrelenting focus on creating 'wow' for our customers across selection, price, and service,"" said Bom Kim, Founder and CEO of Coupang, in the latest earnings release.\n\nThe company's total revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $24.4 billion on a forex-neutral basis in fiscal 2023. In addition, Coupang's gross profit increased 31% from the same period the prior year to $6.2 billion in 2023.\n\nAnalysts expect the company's quarterly revenues to grow 17.8% year-over-year to $6.83 billion in the ongoing quarter ending March. The consensus EPS estimate of $0.07 for the fiscal 2024 first quarter indicates a 40% improvement year-over-year.

He maintained that an award loses respect and importance when it is trivialized. While Musk did not specifically state which elements of the Oscar-nominated movies from this year he considered to be ""woke,"" his remarks appear to be a part of his larger critique of corporate DEI (diversity, equality, and inclusion) programs.\n\nMusk has spoken out against what he sees as ""woke culture"" and has previously said that DEI is just another word for racism. His comments concerned former MMA fighter and actress Gina Carano, who alleged that Musk's X Corporation funded her lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm.\n\nCarano was fired from her role in The Mandalorian in 2021 due to social conflicts. The posts were criticized as transphobic and right-wing. Musk's support for Carano is seen as another example of his opposition to what he sees as excessive political activity.\n\nMusk's criticism of the Oscars is part of a broader pattern of him speaking out against what he sees as ""football"" ideology.

In a Feb. 7 post on X, Seyffart that May 23 is the ""only date that matters"" when it comes to Ether ETFs.\n\nFinally, it appears more people are realizing 'why' alternative currencies (like crypto and precious metals) have seen such demand recently.\n\nAs CoinTelegraph reports, in an X post on March 11, entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan argued that Bitcoin is the only realistic solution to escape the inevitability of unsustainable government spending and potential asset confiscation.\n\n""We're in the looting-the-treasury phase of imperial collapse,"" the former Coinbase chief technology officer told his 994,000 followers.\n\nSrinivasan argued that government debt and wasteful spending continue to grow rapidly at unsustainable levels. U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020.\n\nSrinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and ""simply feed yourself at the trough,"" or:\n\n""Starve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can't easily seize or print.""\n\n""The last is radical but actually realistic,"" he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.\n\n""Debt increasing by $1 trillion every 90 days. America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin. Please take care.""\n\nMeanwhile, Srinivasan also warned that as financial reckoning approaches, the ""ravenous state"" may consider confiscating private assets.\n\nSrinivasan offered a handful of examples, such as the seizing of assets from protesting Canadian truckers, freezing Russian assets and the ""weaponization of Delaware against Elon [Musk] and New York against [Donald] Trump.""\n\n""Private property will not be protected by the state in a bankrupt Blue America,"" he said before adding:\n\n""Fortunately, we have Bitcoin, which isn't dependent on the state and can't easily be seized.""\n\nFinaly, one headline that raised an eyebrow was that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has overtaken MicroStrategy's holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data compiled by BitMEX Research, BlackRock's IBIT holds 197,943 BTC, worth over $13.5 billion as of March 8, nearly 40 trading sessions after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine new funds on Jan. 10.\n\n""I'm going to be buying the top forever.

Still, drugs like psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, and MDMA, or ecstasy, are stirring widespread optimism in some quarters. They're believed to open people up to new ideas or change, a big draw for coaches.\n\nSome coaches work openly at resorts in countries like Jamaica that haven't outlawed the drugs, while others operate quietly out of private homes or Airbnbs in the U.S., where such drugs are federally illegal but authorities largely look the other way. They cater to a rise in popular interest, and often the particular yearnings of ambitious hedge fund principals, entrepreneurs or executives.\n\n""I believe psilocybin helps me be a better me, and therefore helps me be a better leader,"" says Jim MacPhee, a 66-year-old leadership consultant who retired as chief operating officer of Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World in 2021. He doesn't encourage his clients to use drugs, or endorse illegal or recreational use, but says his own two experiences during retirement at an overseas retreat have helped him be more ""dialed in"" to his consulting work.\n\nThe reported drug use of Elon Musk, Sergey Brin and the murdered Cash App executive Bob Lee has brought fresh attention to how the business world is affected by rising use of psychedelics. Common concerns like hyper-suggestibility and changes to the brain's executive function are amplified when it comes to those in positions of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""They make you more vulnerable and suggestible to others,"" says Sandra Dreisbach, a co-founder of Ethical Psychedelic International Community, which encourages integrity among people who work with the drugs. ""Meanwhile, you're more prone to making large significant changes. People can be inclined to quit their job, leave their significant other, or make huge shifts of lifestyle."" She advises anyone to wait a week, or even months, after a psychedelic experience before making major decisions.\n\nEven in traditional financial circles, coaches are finding eager clients. At a ""ketitation"" circle that combined ketamine and meditation in New York last fall, a 56-year-old co-founder of a hedge fund who would only give his name as Joseph sat on the floor of a softly lit loft and listened to session leader Zappy Zapolin. Zapolin touted his past roles at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns before he became a psychedelic ""concierge"" to celebrities, and then the business world.\n\n""This is all about peak performance,"" Zapolin told Joseph and a couple dozen other people, before a light session of Qi Gong movement exercises, acupuncture and ketamine lozenges - plus a spit cup for the heavy salivation they induce.\n\nJoseph said he first tried intravenous-drip ketamine for work stress and depression at a clinic in early 2023, when his fund's performance was weak. ""It helped me to change my mindset and realize that my life isn't tied to my P&L,"" he said, referring to profit-and-loss statements.\n\nRISKS ABOUND\n\nPsychedelic use comes with risks, like lasting perceptual distortions or a sense of detachment from reality, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In California, hospital visits related to hallucinogens rose 54% from 2016 to 2022, according to recent research. Decriminalization hasn't done away with legal risk, either: US seizures of psilocybin soared 247% from 2017 to 2022, a study earlier this year reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin's Third Wave has trained around 200 psychedelic guides since 2021, around a fifth of them executive coaches. At a retreat last fall in the mountains of Colorado, which has decriminalized psychedelic drugs, Austin led ""Psychedelic Trailblazers Mastermind,"" a $3,500-a-head weekend attended by many of Third Wave's students that featured breathwork, intimacy-inducing eye-gazing exercises and lectures - all leading up to a group trip on one of the most powerful strains of psilocybin, Ghost.\n\nOne attendee, Michael, who asked to be identified by his first name only, works in Chicago, where corporate clients pay for his traditional executive coaching sessions. But he's also done underground ceremonies in private homes using MDMA, or ecstasy, and psilocybin. The drugs clear a person's ego out of the way, he said. ""With psychedelics, people are cracked right open.""\n\nMichael, like five other coaches who work with psychedelics interviewed for this story, declined to go into more detail, citing client confidentiality and their own legal risks. Many said they worked with another person who served the actual drugs.\n\nOne coach, Lauren Mugglebee, told a group at Mastermind that she uses vape-pen-type devices with graduated doses of inhalable ""jaguar,"" a synthetic version of the toad-venom derivative 5-MeO-DMT. Known as the ""business trip"" for its short duration, the drug is also called the ""God molecule"" for its powerful effects. It's ripe for abuse, she said, but effective: ""I'm a coach, not a therapist. I'm looking for things to act as a catalyst.""\n\nOMAN, BAHRAIN\n\nRonen Aires, a member of Entrepreneurs' Organization, a group for entrepreneurs who own companies generating at least $1 million in annual revenue, said he's given recent talks on psychedelics to EO groups in Oman and Bahrain. Another EO member and executive coach who helps clients with psychedelics, Mark Worster, said he's spoken on psychedelic use with 18 EO chapters in India, four in the US and one in Nepal. By the time he's finished a tour of India this spring, he estimates he will have reached around 1,000 EO members. An EO spokeswoman said the organization doesn't have a position, official or otherwise, on members' potential use of psychedelics in business.\n\nThe mix of drugs and Type-A personalities can create its own pitfalls, with entrepreneurs potentially going overboard and wanting to roll their own psychedelic experience out at scale. Adding executive coaches to the mix makes it even more potent.\n\n""Coaches are all about 'find your passion and your cosmic why,'"" said Jules Evans, who runs the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project, a nonprofit that studies difficult experiences on the drugs. ""That, combined with these strong imperatives where people seem to get messages from the drug itself, can lead people down blind alleys,"" he said. ""They can be told to build arks, or invest all their money in psychedelics or crypto.""\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Photo: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nAs long as two major civil judgments resist appeal, Donald Trump is poised to lose a lot of money. In January, the former president was ordered to pay $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll in a defamation suit. On February 16, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him to pay $354 million for years of inflating his net worth and other acts of business fraud within the Trump Organization. The former president is still extremely rich in assets, but next year would be the perfect time for him to make some easy money.\n\nThis windfall could come from an unlikely place: Truth Social. In mid-February, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the media company's merger with a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, a somewhat surprising move given the deal's checkered history until 'now.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump would own 78 million shares of the new company, or between 58 and 69 percent of his total shares, with a net worth of nearly $4 billion. But that impressive figure comes with a big caveat: Trump would be unable to sell any shares within six months of the deals closing. By the time he can, their value may have plummeted, especially given the importance of Trump's presidential candidacy to Truth Social's net worth. (On March 22, Digital World will hold a shareholder vote on the merger to determine how to move forward.)\n\nSo far, the SPAC route has failed largely because of an investigation by the SEC into the accuracy of its investor disclosures. In case you forgot, since it peaked around 2021, the process involves a real company combined with a shell company to go public without the scrutiny of an IPO. In this case, the shell company is called Digital World Acquisition Corp. and the real one is Truth Socials' parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group. (Neither responded to requests for comment.) SPACs don't have a high success rate and tend to lose a lot of money for investors. The process has largely gone out of fashion, and new regulations aimed at protecting investors make SPACs even less attractive to companies trying to get rich quick.\n\nThe story of Truth Social followed a similar path to many of Trump's failed companies over the years: media attention and inflation of values in the early days, followed by legal problems, allegations of shady financing and difficulties financial. Truth Social could yet challenge this model. But just like Trump's hopes of staying out of prison, his potential success likely depends on winning the presidency again.\n\nTrump's SPAC deal had been stuck in limbo amid this overall downward trend. In 2022, under investigation by the SEC and unable to rally its shareholders, Digital World Acquisition Corp. missed its first deadline to go public, forcing it to return $1 billion in initial investments. (The SEC ultimately settled with the company for misleading investors, which would result in an $18 million fine if the merger went through.) In 2023, in a separate investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors charged three of Trump's partners with insider trading over the proposed merger. Truth Social's user numbers remain extremely disappointing, and financial statements show that its parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, is losing tens of millions in operating costs for every million it receives in advertising revenue. In an SEC filing in November, the company's accountants wrote that they had serious doubts about staying afloat. And as the September merger deadline approaches, there's no indication they've gotten any closer to SEC approval of their financial disclosure to investors, a necessary step any SPAC must accomplish.\n\nBut hints of a possible turnaround by Truth Social began during the Iowa caucuses in January. After Trump's victory in the first primary, shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp. have surged more than 200%, suggesting that retail investors view the social network as a sort of meme stock or, perhaps, see real value in the company. After a SPAC merger is announced, virtually all of the stock typically moves into the hands of retail investors, says Michael Klausner, a Stanford law professor and SPAC skeptic. This was the case for Digital World Acquisition Corp. These people may think the merger has value, but I wouldn't accept their opinion. I have no reason to believe they know anything.\n\nEven if the merger goes through, any rollback depends on what happens in November. If he were to lose the election, that would be really bad for Truth Social's value, says NYU law professor Michael Ohlrogge, another SPAC skeptic. After all, what value is there in a third-tier social media company chaired by a two-time presidential loser? But if he won, Truth Social's current value could indeed endure. Yes, it would take a divisive politician to win the Electoral College with four criminal cases threatening him, even though stranger things have happened, like Trump winning in the first place.\n\nIn late February, another complication arose when the two men who came up with the idea for Truth Social filed a lawsuit against Trump in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that they were being deprived of the profits that were rightfully theirs from the 'business. Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who both appeared on The Apprentice in 2004, introduced Truth Social to Trump in early 2021. They both reportedly ran the day-to-day operations of the Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the site . Both left amid internal strife in 2022. They filed suit through United Atlantic Ventures, an entity they co-founded.\n\nUnder the original deal negotiated by Litinsky and Moss, Trump was entitled to 90 percent of the company, and Litinsky and Moss to 8.6 percent. (The rest went to a lawyer who negotiated the deal.) Their lawsuit alleges that Trump used what he called 11-hour corporate maneuvers, before the merger, to increase the number of shares authorized in the stock from 120 million to 1 billion and that he plans to give many of these additional shares to himself and/or his associates and children, ultimately reducing the amount Litinsky and Moss should receive to one percent.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Digital World had raised the possibility of legal action by UAV in its filing with the SEC, noting that the case could have a negative impact on investor confidence and perception. of the market. It could also delay the key shareholder vote on March 22.\n\nBut on March 9, the threat of that lawsuit appeared to dissipate after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement during a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court. According to the New York Times, the deal would preserve the two founders' rights to a significant stake in Truth Social's parent company until a judge hears further arguments on the merits of their lawsuit. The presiding judge, Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III, seemed unwilling to push back the March 22 vote date, saying no one is suggesting I should do anything to interfere with the closing, and later remarking that I'm pretty confident we can work. something comes out.\n\nAs with other Trump properties, it's difficult to parse what Truth Social is actually worth. Two years ago, Trump Media & Technology Group was on paper Trump's most valuable asset, with his shares in the company valued at $730 million; this value was crucial in Trump's return to the Forbes list of the 400 richest people on the planet. But Ohlrogge notes that SPACs often inflate values to offset the high cost of such an IPO. There's a real concern here that Trump's media company is inflating its valuation, he says. Trump's accountant feels this way too. In his filing to the Federal Election Commission last year, Trump valued his holdings in Truth Social at between $5 million and $25 million, a far cry from the $1 billion he could hypothetically make from a merger.\n\nThe fact that Trump can still extract money from his lackluster social network helps answer a common question: Why isn't he going back to X? He was once very fond of the app formerly known as Twitter; anyone who has used Truth Social knows they basically ripped them off. And even though X has a growing number of flaws, its estimated monthly user audience is an order of magnitude larger than Truth Social's 500 million, compared to around 600,000.\n\nThere appear to be small reasons why Trump refuses to return. With X's reputation diminishing, Trump doesn't really need it anymore. The combative missives on Truth Social usually end up in the news. Constitutionally, he's not a guy who likes to crawl back; his party has accustomed him to being the one we crawl towards. It also appears that Trump has not resolved his two-year-old spat with X owner Elon Musk, in which he called Twitter worthless and mocked Musk's reliance on regarding federal support for Tesla and SpaceX. I could have told him to get on his knees and beg, and he would have done it, Trump wrote on Truth Social, describing a conversation in which he claimed Musk had asked for government support for a project.\n\nBut there is also a contractual reason for Trump's loyalty to Truth Social. An SEC filing from January says Trump is required to first post on Truth Social six hours before releasing that content elsewhere, a clause that will remain in effect in perpetuity as long as Truth Social is around.

At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty. Tesla had asked for the concessions as a pre-condition for setting up its first manufacturing unit in India.\n\n""Government does not tailor policy for any one individual company or its interests,"" Goyal told PTI when asked about Tesla's request. ""Everybody is free to make their demands. But that does not mean that the government will necessarily take a decision.""\n\nAt the same time, he said that the government is working on collaborations with ""potential investors"" from Europe, the US, the Far East, Japan, and Korea. At present, the Indian EV market is dominated by local giant TATA with four models on the market.\n\nIn 2021, Musk complained on X (formerly Twitter) that India's import duties ""are the highest in the world"" and stated he was hoping for ""temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles."" After meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the US last year, Musk claimed that the Indian leader was ""pushing [Tesla] to make significant investments"" in the country.\n\nLast year in November, Modi's office reportedly held a meeting with senior officials to fast-track Tesla's entry into the Indian market by providing ""all required approvals"" by January 2024. Later that month, Goyal visited Tesla's facility in Fremont, California and said that the company was ""on its way to double its components imports from India.""\n\nAt the time, Goyal asserted that New Delhi wanted more investment from Tesla and a higher output of EVs in the country soon. ""[Having more EVs] will save foreign exchange, reduce our trade deficits, help us in our fight against inflation, thereby helping us in reducing interest rates,"" the minister told PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest budget, the Indian government included an initiative to focus on both manufacturing and charging infrastructure ""to fortify and broaden the landscape for electric vehicles"" as part of its strategy to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

Trading at $1.19, the asset has seen a remarkable 17% daily increase, contributing to an impressive 73% surge over the past week. This surge has sparked speculation among enthusiasts and investors about BONE's potential to reach the coveted $2 mark by the end of March.\n\nAiming for the $2 Milestone\n\nWhile BONE has made attempts to breach the $2 threshold previously, many believe that the current bull run could provide the momentum needed to propel the asset toward this target. Projections from CoinCodex suggest that BONE may indeed hit the $2 mark later in March, buoyed by prevailing market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\nCommunity Drive for Binance Listing\n\nDespite its growing popularity, BONE has yet to secure a listing on Binance, a major global cryptocurrency exchange. However, the Shiba Inu community, known as the ""SHIB Army,"" has united to advocate for BONE's listing on the platform. Leading this advocacy is Shiba Inu content specialist Lucie, who has urged community members to vote for BONE's listing via the Binance Futures Next platform. Lucie's call emphasizes unity within the SHIB Army and encourages active participation to support BONE's potential listing.\n\nAlso Read: Did Elon Musk Buy Any Shiba Inu Tokens During the Bull Run?\n\nThe Path to Listing\n\nCurrently, BONE holds a prominent position among the nominated tokens on the Binance Futures Next platform, garnering substantial support from community members. SHIB Army members are urged to contribute their votes to enhance BONE's chances of listing on Binance. However, Binance emphasizes that while community support is influential, it does not guarantee a token's listing. The exchange maintains a rigorous evaluation process to ensure transparency and fairness.\n\nListing Success and Market Presence\n\nDespite ongoing efforts for a Binance listing, BONE has secured listings on other prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, HTX, Gate.io, MEXC, Bitget, and Crypto.Com Exchange. These listings underscore BONE's growing presence in the crypto market and its appeal to investors seeking exposure to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of BONE reaching $2 by the end of March 2024 remains a subject of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. With active community support and continued market momentum, BONE's journey toward this milestone reflects the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape and the collective efforts of enthusiasts to foster innovation and adoption in the ecosystem.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Forecasted To Hit 6 Cents: Here's When\n\nREAD SOURCE",businesstelegraph.co.uk,news,Business Telegraph,,,,,https://usercontent.one/wp/www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shiba-Inu-Can-BONE-Hit-2-This-March-2024.jpeg,eng-9380522,0.4666666666666666,447883099,1

Plus it's now battle-tested and battle-hardened, especially against Western weapons,"" he said.\n\nMusk appeared to agree with Sacks, commenting on the post on X: ""Unfortunately, this is true.""\n\nCiting the size of Russia's army compared to Ukraine's, Sacks stated that Biden has ""created"" a much more ""formidable"" Russian military. Meanwhile, it's the US that has seen its stockpiles ""depleted and hollowed out,"" he argued.\n\nThe economic sanctions on Russia have become another major miscalculation of Biden's policies, according to Sacks. He believes that the idea to ""crush"" Russia with sanctions was delusional as the country's economy stabilized and even outperformed G7 economies in 2023.\n\n""The Russian economy is growing faster than any of the G7 economies. It's really booming and it's our European allies' economies that have been crushed by the sanctions,"" he noted.\n\nBut it is Ukraine that has been suffering the most from US involvement in the conflict, he argued. He attacked Biden who claimed that the US would ""help ease the suffering of the Ukrainians"" but in fact, Washington's support ""of this proxy war and our willingness to fight to the last Ukrainian"" has led to a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""\n\nThis is not the first time the two men have been in alignment on such issues. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with Sacks' statement on X that NATO ""faced an existential crisis"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union and decided to embark on an expansion spree to fill the void.\n\nThe US has been Ukraine's primary backer and has provided over $111 billion in military and financial assistance. However, in recent months, US aid has subsided drastically as the administration of President Joe Biden has struggled to overcome Republican resistance to its efforts to push through another $60 billion for Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has said that the US and its allies who continue to arm Ukraine cannot prevent Russia from achieving its goals and are only prolonging the suffering of Ukrainians.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,,,,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/MGY3NzUzYWMtYzR.jpg,null,0.058823529,447882955,1

This obviously makes no sense.\n\nOn Friday, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) forced a vote on an amendment that would have required the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question in any future census, and then bar all non-citizens from being counted for purposes of congressional district and Electoral College apportionment.\n\nDemocrats, who have openly admitted they WANT the illegal aliens to count towards helping them gain more congressional seats and electoral votes, voted the measure down.\n\nMusk responded to the news, first writing:\n\nMost Americans do not know that the US census currently counts, for purposes of voting power, all people in a district, regardless of citizenship!\n\nSenate Democrats just voted unanimously to defeat an amendment that would have stopped counting illegals for congressional seat apportionment and electoral college (presidential) votes.\n\nSince illegals are mostly in Democrat states, both the House and the Presidential vote are shifted ~5% to the left, which is enough to change the entire balance of power!\n\nThis is a major reason why the Biden administration is ushering in record levels of illegals and doing so few deportations.\n\nAnother X user, The Rabbit Hole, posted a poll, asking if people were aware that illegal aliens are counted in determining how many House seats each state gets. A full 51% said no, they were not aware.\n\nMusk responded to the poll, ""This is the biggest corruption of American democracy in the 21st century.""\n\nSen. Hagerty said in an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, ""Democrats want these illegal migrants in here to create more electoral power. Since Joe Biden came into office, the estimates are as high as 10 million people that have come in here -- that would be 13 extra congressional districts.""\n\nMusk replied with a sobering warning: ""More Presidential and House of Representatives electoral votes will be assigned to the new illegals Biden has let in than the population of 40 US states. Let that sink in.""\n\nAlex Lorusso wrote, ""By counting illegal aliens in the census, it incentivizes Democrats to continue the invasion in order to build up power.""\n\nMusk replied, ""Exactly. Increasing illegals boosts Dem voting power, causing them to recruit even more!""\n\n""If Dems win President, House & Senate (with enough seats to overcome filibuster), they'll grant citizenship to all illegals & America will become a permanent one-party deep socialist state.""\n\nSunday evening, Musk posted a image of a sign that reads, ""Trying to help people understand what's going on right now is like going back into a burning building to pull someone out. Only to have them keep punching you in the face and demand evidence that the building is on fire. Even after they admit they can see the flames.\n\nMusk has also responded to an old video of Barack Obama speaking in 2009 is recirculating on social media.\n\nIn the video, Obama touts a legal process for people to go to the back of the line and earn their citizenship, and admits, ""We can't have half a million people pouring over the border...""\n\nMusk wrote, ""Now, 10 times as many people per year are ""pouring over the border"", to use Obama's words. America is 4% of Earth's population. If even 1% of Earth moves here - and there is every incentive to do so - that is 80 million people.""\n\nMusk blasted Biden for voicing regret that he called the Venezuelan man who killed Georgia university student Laken Riley an ""illegal.""\n\nBiden later said in an MSNBC interview that he should have said ""undocumented.""\n\n""Biden is just a grim puppet. He spoke out of turn and was instructed to bend the knee in ignominy,"" Musk wrote.\n\nA Biden parody account on X joked, ""Stop calling them ""illegals."" They're ""voters.""\n\nMusk responded to another post by End Wokeness, who writes, ""California's most insane bill yet? Meet AB 2031, a new bill just introduced by Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer.\n\n""The bill seeks to grant illegals convicted of SERIOUS and VOlLENT crimes with legal assistance, such as helping them avoid deportation.

More big tech entrepreneurs like Tim Cook or Elon Musk have to learn over time which routine best suits them.\n\nAnd of course, many times the habits of magnates differ in several aspects, except in one: agree to yield.\n\nThe current CEO of Apple knows how habits can positively influence productivity and be professional. By isso, Every day Tim Cook starts his days at 3:45 in the morning.\n\nAfter agreeing, she begins her routine with a email verificationalso taking into account the work issues that you will have to face today.\n\nAfterwards, continue with a session of exercises 30 to 45 minutes in your personal academy at 5 hours a day, because, as he stated on several occasions, this combination is ideal to start the day with energy and mental clarity.\n\nAfter drinking coffee, you have lunch quickly, Cook schedules important meetings for the rest of your day. Generally, he can spend the entire work day in meetings. The lunch at the Apple Park casino along with the other officials, and in the afternoon he goes home, where his meal is a complete mystery.\n\nOn the other hand, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is less reserved in relation to his daily habits, the first difference we find in relation to Cook is that He avoids at all costs activities such as taking calls or checking emailsbecause you consider unnecessary distractions.\n\nThat's why Musk's schedule is meticulously organized to maximize every moment of the day. Um example? To begin with, or also on Twitter, sleep for six hours a day.\n\nHis day begins on seven days, when he plans his schedules. Além disso, it is known that Musk generally polishes manhã coffee, but he occasionally opts for a coffee and an omelete.\n\nNot so much, or morning bath It is essential for Musk, who prefers to spend time taking baths than drinking manhã coffee.\n\nNot that he says respect for the work, as weeks of work usually range between 85 and 100 hours of work; He dedicates himself exclusively to Tesla to his third, fourth and fifth hours, accumulating about 42 hours a week; While the second and sixth fairs are reserved for SpaceX.\n\nAt the end of the day, Musk is going to sleep for one night, after ensuring that he has completed all his pending tasks. Generally he goes to school at least twice a week and dedicates his weekends to hanging out with his children.\n\nResearch suggests that agreeing to give up offers a period of tranquility that is essential for personal organization and preparation for daily challenges.

In a rare example of bipartisanship, that declaration seems to have awakened our leaders to the threat such a powerful, anti-American propaganda tool holds. Now, TikTok executives are worried they're running out of time.\n\nAnd they might be right.\n\nTikTok is one of the world's largest social media apps. It's owned by China's ByteDance, which is really like saying that it does the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party. The results are alarming. China manipulates the news our young people see and turns them against America in an outlandish abuse of press freedom. And the app gathers tons of data on them in the process.\n\nTRUMP SAYS TIKTOK A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT BUT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL 'GO CRAZY' WITHOUT IT\n\nIt is widely considered a Chinese spy app and is banned from government phones, though the Biden administration (D-Hypocrites) still has a campaign account on TikTok. Congress has been holding hearings on what to do about the app and its dangerous algorithm. The hearings could force the owners to sell it or possibly have it shut down. So, TikTok called on its millions of devoted followers to harass their congresspeople.\n\nThe result wasn't a typical pressure campaign. Those happen all the time. This was essentially a foreign government pressuring our government to let it continue its anti-American propaganda. TikTok users were warned to, ""speak up now - before your government strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.""\n\nThe wording in the TikTok call to action of course left out how the bill is just forcing the sale on the owners. But when has the genocidal Chinese government cared about facts, rights or law? Pretty much never.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, ""individual House offices have since received hundreds of calls from TikTok users, at times fielding upward of 20 a minute, according to eight congressional aides.""\n\nCongressional offices reported getting many calls from citizens as young as 12 - some even threatening suicide if the app were shut down. Some offices turned over their phones to turn off the onslaught. The BBC summed up the result nicely, ""Desperate TikTok lobbying effort backfires on Capitol Hill.""\n\nThe bill passed the committee 50-0. It is scheduled for a full House vote on Tuesday, March 12. President Joe Biden has also indicated his support. ""If they pass it, I'll sign it,"" he said.\n\nKEVIN O'LEARY OFFERS TO BUY TIKTOK AND TURN IT INTO A 'NEW AMERICAN COMPANY' IF PROPOSED BAN ADVANCES\n\nTikTok responded by claiming it has rights. China, for the record, is a Marxist dictatorship that regularly threatens its neighbors with attacks and viciously shuts down even tiny hints of freedom like in Hong Kong.\n\n""This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it. This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said in a statement.\n\nWe can hope so.\n\nRecently, TikTok launched a media campaign to push back against congressional efforts. It's called, ""TikTok Sparks Good"" and features some of its top creators defending what they are able to do with the platform. Cody and Erika Archie were some of the prominent users who clocked in with their support. The ""first-generation ranchers from Gatesville, Texas,"" have 1.2 million followers on the app and say that, ""TikTok is helping us protect this way of life for future generations.""\n\nThey seem like nice folks and I can't blame them for not wanting to lose the platform. But Congress has to look at the bigger picture and the many threats posed by China.\n\nTikTok has more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, which is a terrifying power if misused. It has been blamed for ""pushing children and young people towards harmful mental health content,"" according to Amnesty International. That includes ""multiple recommended videos in a single hour romanticizing, normalizing or encouraging suicide.""\n\nOthers have tied TikTok to the horrific rise in antisemitism in the West, especially among young people who love the app. Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said TikTok is the reason for giving people a ""warped or not reflective of the history"" view of Israel's war against terrorist Hamas. Even Osama bin Laden's ""Letter to America"" was popular for a time on TikTok.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe version of the app we get here isn't even allowed in China. Their version urges young people to learn and better themselves, not to waste their days becoming ""influencers.""\n\nOur leaders have been wrestling with the influence China has on American social media for some time. India solved the problem in 2020 by banning TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps. American politicians have been more divided because of our tradition of free press - even though TikTok's ultimate bosses don't believe in the concept.\n\nMany conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, are concerned about the ban. Trump said he doesn't want to aid TikTok competitors like Facebook, which often censor conservatives. ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!"" he posted on Truth Social.\n\nTrump is correct about the dangers of other social media. Facebook, YouTube and pre-Elon Musk Twitter all twisted their policies to target the right. But that doesn't mean a foreign app like TikTok should be allowed to manipulate our politics. On Monday, Trump clarified his comments and explained why he's backed away from his effort to ban China-owned app.\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., voiced concerns that people on both sides of the aisle hold. He accused TikTok of ""targeting American children with Chinese Communist Party propaganda -- during school hours -- and recruiting minors to act as foreign agents for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd that's the way we need to look at this, big time.

This decision comes amidst a lawsuit filed by Musk against rival AI chatbot developer OpenAI. In a recent post on the X social media platform dated March 11th, Musk revealed that Grok would be available as open-source software starting from this week.\n\nElon Musk set to make Grok open-source\n\nThe move to make Grok open source has received largely positive responses from users, with many praising Musk for the decision. This announcement comes in the wake of a lawsuit Musk filed against OpenAI on February 29th, alleging a breach of agreement made when OpenAI was established as a nonprofit organization.\n\nMusk contends that OpenAI's recent partnership with Microsoft contradicts the founding principles of the nonprofit agreement, which aimed to advance open-source artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the betterment of humanity. According to Elon Musk, Microsoft's investment of nearly $3 billion in OpenAI by the end of 2023 further complicates matters, as it suggests a shift away from OpenAI's original mission towards more profit-driven objectives.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Elon Musk calls for OpenAI to return to its initial open-source principles and seeks an injunction to halt the for-profit exploitation of AGI technology. However, following the filing of the lawsuit, OpenAI executives released a joint statement revealing emails from Elon Musk that seemed to support the company's transition into a for-profit entity. This revelation has added layers of complexity to the legal battle between Musk and OpenAI.\n\nSince the initiation of the lawsuit, there have been organizational changes within OpenAI, including the reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman as a member of the board. Altman had been fired and subsequently re-hired in November 2023, with the board admitting that his departure had destabilized the company more than anticipated.\n\nMusk's intention for Grok and the OpenAI lawsuit\n\nMusk's decision to release Grok as open source aligns with his stated goals in the lawsuit to promote open-source AGI for the benefit of humanity. Grok, developed by Musk's company xAI, is an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, but with the added capability to access real-time information via the X social media platform.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT, Grok can tackle more contentious issues that other AI systems might avoid. However, access to Grok requires users to have a verified X account. In terms of performance, Grok AI, powered by the Grok-1 large language model, has been compared favorably to ChatGPT-3.5 but falls short of OpenAI's latest model, ChatGPT-4, according to some assessments.\n\nElon Musk's decision to make Grok open source represents a significant development in the ongoing debate over the future of AI development and its implications for society. By making Grok freely available to the public, Musk aims to foster greater collaboration and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence while also challenging the direction taken by organizations like OpenAI.\n\nAs the lawsuit between Musk and OpenAI continues to unfold, it raises important questions about the responsibilities of tech companies in advancing AI technologies and the ethical considerations surrounding their use.

At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty. Tesla had asked for the concessions as a pre-condition for setting up its first manufacturing unit in India.\n\n""Government does not tailor policy for any one individual company or its interests,"" Goyal told PTI when asked about Tesla's request. ""Everybody is free to make their demands. But that does not mean that the government will necessarily take a decision.""\n\nAt the same time, he said that the government is working on collaborations with ""potential investors"" from Europe, the US, the Far East, Japan, and Korea. At present, the Indian EV market is dominated by local giant TATA with four models on the market.\n\nIn 2021, Musk complained on X (formerly Twitter) that India's import duties ""are the highest in the world"" and stated he was hoping for ""temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles."" After meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the US last year, Musk claimed that the Indian leader was ""pushing [Tesla] to make significant investments"" in the country.\n\nLast year in November, Modi's office reportedly held a meeting with senior officials to fast-track Tesla's entry into the Indian market by providing ""all required approvals"" by January 2024. Later that month, Goyal visited Tesla's facility in Fremont, California and said that the company was ""on its way to double its components imports from India.""\n\nAt the time, Goyal asserted that New Delhi wanted more investment from Tesla and a higher output of EVs in the country soon. ""[Having more EVs] will save foreign exchange, reduce our trade deficits, help us in our fight against inflation, thereby helping us in reducing interest rates,"" the minister told PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest budget, the Indian government included an initiative to focus on both manufacturing and charging infrastructure ""to fortify and broaden the landscape for electric vehicles"" as part of its strategy to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

Co-founded by LGBTQ+ activist Eric Cervini; his partner, Adam Powell, a noted drag performer; and celebrity cross-dresser RuPaul, Allstora was created to be an ""independent bookstore committed to sharing all stories and sharing profits fairly.""\n\nNot only did Cervini, Powell, and RuPaul initially insist on giving authors a higher share of the profits from their books, but they also took a hard stance against censorship. ""At Allstora, we believe that the censorship of any book, perspective, or story is incompatible with the survival of democracy,"" its website said as recently as March 6. ""We cannot fight the ideologies of hate if we lack the ability to study, understand, and react to them.""\n\nThat ""decision to carry all books"" angered many leftists, especially those who identify somewhere along the LGBTQ+ spectrum. LGBTQ Nation railed that Allstora dared to carry books written by ""anti-LGBTQ+ extremists,"" such as the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh; Chaya Raichik, better known on social media as Libs of TikTok, whom LGBTQ Nation called a ""hate monger""; and Abigail Shrier, described as ""transphobic."" Others objected to Allstora selling books by former President Donald Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nAllstora tried to quell their concerns by flagging certain titles that ""are contrary to our core values."" The store even promised to donate all proceeds from sales of those titles ""to fight book bans.""\n\nBut the leftist onslaught continued unabated, and Allstora folded to pressure within days. On March 9, Cervini released a full-page statement that chronicled his rapid transition from anti-censorship advocate to mob apologist.\n\n""We envisioned a bookstore that split its profits with all authors: not just queer and trans storytellers, but also Black, Brown, disabled, neurodiverse, everyone,"" Cervini wrote. ""A place where all the infinite intersections of humanity could find their books, their people.""\n\n""As a historian, I understood that even the most hateful of books can have educational value,"" he continued. ""I knew that to dismantle prejudice, we must examine its illogic. We must study history so as not to repeat it, and we must understand hatred if we are to destroy it.""\n\nBut in his attempt to understand his enemies, Cervini said he soon realized that he had unwittingly created an ""unsafe"" platform where ""queer or trans youth"" might ""accidentally stumbl[e] upon a harmful book.""\n\n""I confused my duties as an academic and a bookseller, and I brought pain instead of joy into the world. And for that, I am sorry,"" he said.\n\nCervini then noted that ""the most harmful books"" had been removed from Allstora's catalog and invited shoppers to ""continue to report any instances of hateful material on our site.""\n\n""As we continue to grow, I'm committed to doing a better job of listening and learning from the communities that we hope to nurture.

It allows permit holders to live, work and study in SA.\n\nFritz has been heavily attacked on social media because the HSF challenged the government on the ZEP.\n\nThe abuse and threats she received from one X user were particularly distressing, resulting in her taking him to court.\n\n""While I've been a kind of central target, he's also targeted other women. The threats were extensive and fairly regular -- threats of being necklaced or real physical harm to me and my family,"" Fritz said.\n\nShe asked Daily Maverick not to publish the individual's name due to the attention it might garner him.\n\nWhile the individual did not deny the threats in court, he argued that Fritz should have understood that he didn't mean them and wouldn't have acted on them.\n\n""He said I should have understood that, particularly because Twitter/X had not censored him, they hadn't taken down his tweets or his accounts, and therefore there was a sense in which what he was saying, and the threats he was issuing, and the harassment was okay,"" she said.\n\nSince Elon Musk acquired Twitter/X, any regulatory mechanisms, particularly in Africa, had been discarded, Fritz said.\n\n""It's frightening that people will get the sense, because they're not being sanctioned or censored by X, particularly here in South Africa, that this kind of engagement, this type of intimidation, harassment is okay.""\n\nSocial media law expert Emma Sadleir said the X user's argument that because the social media platform had not censored him his abuse was acceptable, was ""totally wrong"".\n\n""There's a huge problem with illegal content, particularly on Twitter, but on all social media platforms. Twitter is the worst because when Elon Musk took over Twitter, he basically fired the whole moderation team,"" she said.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: X marks the spot where the fundamentals of democracy were put to the torch\n\nSadleir said it was clear to see the voyage into zero moderation with the content on the platform, including pornography and sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift.\n\n""We do see them sometimes taking action. But there's a lot, a lot, a lot of illegal content on Twitter. Now they have so-called community guidelines and they're very badly enforced, if at all,"" she said.\n\nIn the US, the Communications Decency Act essentially provides immunity for social media companies.\n\n""They basically say, 'Look, Twitter, Facebook, you're not responsible for the content you're hosting just because you provide the platform', and it is very controversial,"" Sadleir said.\n\n""I've seen child sexual abuse, and child pornography on Twitter; just because it's not taken down doesn't mean it's legal.""\n\nSadleir explained that South Africa's Protection from Harassment Act ""allows ... for somebody to get a protection order against somebody who is harassing them, threatening them, stalking them, in the real world or online.\n\n""There's even a mechanism actually to get a protection order against an anonymous person, which is fabulous. A lot of people call this law the cyberbullying law and I've even got teenage clients who've managed to get protection orders against people who are cyberbullying them.""\n\nThere is a threshold that must be met to obtain this.\n\n""You have to show that there's harm or a fear of harm. It can be mental, psychological, physical or financial harm,"" Sadleir said.\n\nThe passing of the Cybercrimes Act in June 2021 has also been beneficial.\n\nThe Act criminalises a wide variety of cybercrimes, including crimes specifically associated with cyberbullying such as:\n\n""So if I send you a text message, or a voice note or a DM [direct message] tomorrow, and then I never see you again, it's a criminal offence,"" Sadleir said.\n\nSadleir said obtaining a protection order was relatively inexpensive and simple.\n\n""If I had to go rush off to the high court and get an interdict, that's a very expensive process. Whereas a protection order, you can literally go off to the magistrates' court, fill in a form that they give you, and get issued an interim protection order,"" she said.\n\n""And then you all go back on the return day, and you argue why it should be made permanent and the other person (if they turn up), argues why it should not, and then if you get it, it's valid for five years.""\n\nSadleir said each protection order is different, but it essentially means that if that person so much as sends you an SMS, again, they can be arrested.\n\n""It has, in many instances, the effect of sort of a high court interdict, just you can do it for free. It's a much more accessible piece of law than, for example, a defamation interdict, or suing for damages. You can even download the form from the internet and fill it in at home,"" she said.\n\nFritz said the magistrate in her case was ""fantastic"" and made it clear to the individual that contravening the protection order would lead to him either facing a prison term of five years or a fine of R180,000.\n\n""But it was more important because the social media platforms and I think particularly X, are just so negligent at this point, particularly under Musk's leadership in ensuring that it is a space for robust speech, but not speech that actually traffics in hate, intimidation, threats and harassment,"" Fritz said.\n\nShe said it was an important outcome as women, particularly women in the public eye or who assume public roles, were often subjected to vicious intimidation and harassment on social media.\n\n""For a lot of women in similar situations, it's not clear what tools they might have available to them and what they can do to try and protect them; and whilst it's imperfect, I do think it's important that there be greater public awareness of being able to apply for this type of protective order,"" she said.

At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty. Tesla had asked for the concessions as a pre-condition for setting up its first manufacturing unit in India.\n\n""Government does not tailor policy for any one individual company or its interests,"" Goyal told PTI when asked about Tesla's request. ""Everybody is free to make their demands. But that does not mean that the government will necessarily take a decision.""\n\nAt the same time, he said that the government is working on collaborations with ""potential investors"" from Europe, the US, the Far East, Japan, and Korea.

One example read:\n\nMacKenzie Scott plans to give away all her money. So far she's given away $16.5 billion. She's even giving away money to nonprofits that aren't asking for money. ""I'm not stopping until the safe is empty""\n\nThe above post, which garnered 23.6 million views and 88,000 likes, was shared widely by other users. We encountered a similar post on Instagram, which had gained more than 84,000 likes and 17,000 comments at the time of this writing:\n\nIn short, Scott has documented her donations of billions of dollars and promised to continue giving away money, so we rate this claim as ""True.""\n\nAfter 26 years of marriage to Bezos, Scott walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, which was then worth about $37 billion (according to Forbes, she had a net worth of $35 billion as of this writing). As soon as 2020, she began to donate money to a growing list of nonprofit groups. According to her fund's website, she had completed gifts adding up to more than $16.5 billion to 1,964 groups at the time we reported this.\n\nScott has endeavored to be transparent about her philanthropic efforts. Besides shedding light on the process for awarding money to organizations, Scott wrote a series of blog posts explaining her thinking. On May 25, 2019, less than two months after her divorce from Bezos was announced, she wrote on the website of The Giving Pledge (emphasis added):\n\nWe each come by the gifts we have to offer by an infinite series of influences and lucky breaks we can never fully understand. In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share. My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care. But I won't wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.\n\nShe reiterated that pledge in July 2020, in a long post on Medium:\n\nLast year I pledged to give the majority of my wealth back to the society that helped generate it, to do it thoughtfully, to get started soon, and to keep at it until the safe is empty. There's no question in my mind that anyone's personal wealth is the product of a collective effort, and of social structures which present opportunities to some people, and obstacles to countless others.\n\nIn this post, she also listed the causes to which she had donated money in the months prior. Topping that list were the following causes (by donation amounts):\n\nWho is Bezos' ex giving money to?\n\nAccording to her fund's website, over half of the orgs to which she's donated so far deal with issues of race and/or gender.\n\nHer fund ought to be called The AWFL Fund. It's the ultimate aspirational expression of the most awful group in the US.\n\nThis is the post that drew the attention and the ire of Tesla and X owner Elon Musk.

Additionally, as we approach key resistance levels, short-term speculative traders trying to call a top, short into these key levels and then get liquidated, causing a pseudo negative gamma effect which propels us higher.""\n\nAdditionally, as CoinTelegraph reports, amid the inbound price discovery, seasoned Bitcoin hodlers are keeping their hard-earned coins firmly in their wallets.\n\nData from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows long-term holders (LTHs) not yet matching transfer volumes seen during 2021, the year when BTC/USD first hit $69,000.\n\n""Bitcoin's most convicted holders are still holding at unrealized profit levels that usually occur well before the cycle peak,"" it told X followers on March 11.\n\nEven President Trump has come around the the idea of Bitcoin...\n\nAnd it's not just Bitcoin that is seeing investor interest as Ethereum tops $4000 for the first time since Dec 2021...\n\nEther's price performance appears to be boosted by Ethereum's upcoming Dencun update and the possible approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC.\n\nCoinTelegraph reports that the Dencun upgrade, the most significant improvement to the Ethereum network since the Merge, aims to implement a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which introduces ""proto-danksharding.""\n\nProto-danksharding is a feature that allows the blockchain to use blobs, thereby simplifying the transaction process by storing some data off the blockchain, speeding up transactions and cutting costs for layer-2 chains and rollups that depend on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum developers have set the Dencun mainnet to go live on March 13.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the SEC will not take as long to process Ether ETF applications as it did with Bitcoin ETFs. In a Feb. 7 post on X, Seyffart that May 23 is the ""only date that matters"" when it comes to Ether ETFs.\n\nFinally, it appears more people are realizing 'why' alternative currencies (like crypto and precious metals) have seen such demand recently.\n\nAs CoinTelegraph reports, in an X post on March 11, entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan argued that Bitcoin is the only realistic solution to escape the inevitability of unsustainable government spending and potential asset confiscation.\n\n""We're in the looting-the-treasury phase of imperial collapse,"" the former Coinbase chief technology officer told his 994,000 followers.\n\nSrinivasan argued that government debt and wasteful spending continue to grow rapidly at unsustainable levels. U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020.\n\nSrinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and ""simply feed yourself at the trough,"" or:\n\n""Starve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can't easily seize or print.""\n\n""The last is radical but actually realistic,"" he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.\n\n""Debt increasing by $1 trillion every 90 days. America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin. Please take care.""\n\nMeanwhile, Srinivasan also warned that as financial reckoning approaches, the ""ravenous state"" may consider confiscating private assets.\n\nSrinivasan offered a handful of examples, such as the seizing of assets from protesting Canadian truckers, freezing Russian assets and the ""weaponization of Delaware against Elon [Musk] and New York against [Donald] Trump.""\n\n""Private property will not be protected by the state in a bankrupt Blue America,"" he said before adding:\n\n""Fortunately, we have Bitcoin, which isn't dependent on the state and can't easily be seized.""\n\nFinaly, one headline that raised an eyebrow was that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has overtaken MicroStrategy's holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data compiled by BitMEX Research, BlackRock's IBIT holds 197,943 BTC, worth over $13.5 billion as of March 8, nearly 40 trading sessions after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine new funds on Jan. 10.\n\n""I'm going to be buying the top forever.

2024-03-285573670,eng,FALSE,11/3/24,19:26:21,2024-03-11T19:26:21Z,2024-03-11T19:23:11Z,news,0,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4677413-rivian-sell-the-r2-hype-downgrade,Rivian: Sell The R2 Hype (Downgrade) (NASDAQ:RIVN),"Rivian could use another capital raise as losses and cash burn will continue for several quarters, despite two debt offerings already in 2023.\n\nBack in February, I discussed why I would not be a buyer of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) shares after the company's mixed Q4 report. With production guidance implying little volume growth this year, and losses and cash burn remaining quite high, I thought there might be some additional pain to come. Last week, the company unveiled its second-generation vehicle to a tremendous amount of hype, but the recent rally in shares now has me turning negative on the name.\n\nLast Thursday was the highly awaited event where Rivian showed off its new R2 SUV. The vehicle will start at $45,000, but that appears to be a ""base"" version that will not have over 300 miles of range. Like the company's current R1 platform, you can get bigger batteries to allow for more range, but these add-ons can be very costly. It's not clear at this point if the R2 will be able to receive the full $7,500 EV tax credit. That credit also assumes the US political situation remains the same, as the election this fall could swing things that result in the credit potentially being eliminated by the time the R2 is available. As we've seen with many electric vehicles, the lowest announced priced model doesn't come right at the beginning of availability and can take several years to get depending on the company's situation.\n\nAfter the R2 unveil, I saw a lot of people calling this the ""Model 3 moment"" for Rivian, referring to when Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) launched its mass-market vehicle in 2016 after selling two luxury vehicles to that point. While that is the path that Rivian seems to be following, it's not as comparable as you might think. Tesla was calling for a $35,000 vehicle with a $7,500 tax credit, which even adjusting for the inflation we've seen since would only equate to about $36,000 today. If Rivian only gets half of the EV credit, the cheapest variant of the R2 would come in at more than $41,000. Elon Musk reported 180,000 orders for the Model 3 in the first 24 hours, with each requiring a $1,000 deposit, whereas Rivian had over 68,000 deposits down at $100 each as of Friday morning.\n\nRivian is entering a vastly different competitive situation here as well. Tesla was basically only competing with the Nissan Leaf at the time it launched the Model 3. Currently, you can get a base Tesla Model Y for $36,490 after the Federal tax credit, and it will have similar performance specs to the base R2 that is at least two years away. Last Friday, Chevy announced sales were starting again for its Blazer EV, which is quite comparable to the R2 as well, and other players like Kia, Honda, Hyundai, etc. have electric SUVs available now or coming soon.\n\nRivian also announced another model last week, the R3, which will be smaller and come after the R2. No pricing, specs, or an availability timeline were given, but this unexpected reveal was nothing more than pure hype for now. I say this because perhaps the biggest news that came out of last week was that Rivian is pausing its plans for its new Georgia factory, instead launching the R2 out of its Illinois factory in the first half of 2026. This move will save an estimated $2.25 billion between capital expenditures and operating expenses according to management. The Georgia factory will eventually come and produce the R2 and then the R3, meaning the smaller vehicle is a 2027 item at the earliest, which is why I wouldn't put much focus on it currently.\n\nRivian certainly did a 180 here, and I think it speaks to some desperation from the company as well as the financial situation being weaker than it seems. It was just a year ago at the Q4 2022 conference call that management believed it had enough cash to get through the end of 2025. Yet, Rivian went out twice last year and hit the debt markets, raising $2.8 billion in convertible debt. Unlike the Tesla Model 3 deposit surge, which brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in a week or two, Rivian's R2 deposits are likely to only bring in tens of millions at best. Tesla didn't have the cash pile that Rivian currently does back in 2016, but it wasn't burning as much, and it did produce almost 84,000 vehicles that year, as compared to Rivian's guidance for 57,000 in production in 2024.\n\nInterestingly enough, Rivian shares so far this year have shown some similar trends to Tesla in 2016. As the chart below shows, Tesla shares tanked to begin the year, which Rivian has done, before rebounding into the new model reveal. Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on March 31st, and interestingly enough, shares hit their peak for the year the next week, before falling again. Rivian has seen its shares bounce 27% from their recent low, and those gains would have been even higher if not for the overall market rally on Friday getting wiped out and then some.\n\nRivian shares have jumped about 17% since my prior article, with the S&P 500 being roughly flat over that time. The price-to-sales valuation here has ticked up slightly to 2.56 times this year's expected revenue, mostly a function of analyst estimates coming down, and was over 2.70 times at Friday's high. However, when I talked about the major discount to Tesla in my last article, Tesla was at nearly 5.6 times its expected sales. Since then, we've seen a bunch of bad news regarding Tesla, including weak China sales and its Berlin factory shut down due to an arson attack on the power grid. Tesla now only goes for about 5.1 times its expected 2024 revenue, so the valuation gap has certainly narrowed.\n\nRivian finished 2022 with total cash of more than $11.5 billion against debt of just $1.2 billion. However, due to large losses and cash burn, the company finished 2023 with cash of about $9.4 billion, but debt was also up to more than $4.4 billion. The other thing that differentiates Rivian from Tesla here is that when the Model 3 was unveiled, Tesla had a market cap of more than $30.75 billion. Even after last week's rally, Rivian's market cap stands at just $12.5 billion, meaning any capital raises are a bit more painful to swallow.\n\nGiven everything that happened last week, I am now downgrading Rivian to a sell. The valuation increase isn't justified given Tesla's valuation decrease. The R2 won't be here for at least two years, and there's a lot more competition now than when Tesla launched its mass-market Model 3. I believe another capital raise will come, and it's possible that last week's unveil was set up just to prepare for that. The pausing of the Georgia factory does ding the growth story in the medium term, even while saving some money, and the R3 will be several years off. Investors are now going to focus on the current business, and Rivian is about to shut down its plant for upgrades that will pressure revenues in the near term. It remains to be seen if last week's reveal will thus pressure sales of the current lineup as consumers wait for the R2, and how the addition of leasing options for the R1 line will impact the financials.\n\nFor me to bring my rating back to a hold, I need to see a couple of things happen. First, I need to see Rivian get through this plant upgrade period and show that it has resulted in the cost savings that management expects. Getting to gross profits in Q4 will be tough given the company hasn't had gross margins better than negative 36% in any quarter recently. Second, I need to see the company raise more capital to de-risk the balance sheet through the start of the R2 launch and to get the Georgia factory plans back on track. Finally, I need to see the valuation improve a bit, given all the weakness we've seen in EV stocks in recent months. Should the price-to-sales figure come down to around 2 times this year's expected revenues, I would consider looking at my rating again.\n\nIn conclusion, the hype and rally in Rivian shares surrounding last week's R2 unveil is not warranted in my opinion. The company's cheaper SUV won't be here for at least two years and enters a much tougher EV landscape than when Tesla launched the Model 3. Tesla shares peaked the week after its major reveal, falling back to reality as investors went back to scrutinizing how the actual business was doing. With Rivian's valuation rising ahead of a potential capital raise, I think investors should step aside here.\n\nI am a market enthusiast and part-time trader.

As a software developer working on bank treasury and blockchain applications, I'm a big proponent of blockchain technology's potential. However, my enthusiasm is not blind to the limitations and problems found in specific blockchain implementations.\n\nBitcoin's 2017 highs, brought my attention to what I consider a critical flaw in Bitcoin's use of the proof-of-work algorithm. Bitcoin's excessive energy consumption makes it unsustainable for use as a major cryptocurrency or a store of value. Though I have followed many discussions addressing Bitcoin's energy consumption since then, some by prominent figures such as Cathie Wood and Elon Musk, I believe the issue remains fundamentally misunderstood. Instead of preserving value, Bitcoin's inherent design paradoxically destroys it. And no one seems to care.\n\nIn this article, I will try to analyse this flaw, challenge the prevailing narratives and offer a perspective based on thought experiments and empirical evidence.\n\nBefore we get to the promised thought experiment, let's summarize how Bitcoin works. We will focus only on the key points crucial to our discussion.\n\nBitcoin is a distributed network of specialized computers (nodes). Each node collects pending transactions, groups them into a block, and locks the block with a special cryptographic hash. A valid hash is very specific in such a way that it can't be simply computed but needs to be guessed. This guessing requires lots of trials and errors, and these trials require substantial computational power.\n\nAfter successfully discovering a valid hash, a node broadcasts the new block to the network. The Bitcoin network then verifies the block and appends it to the blockchain. With this, all transactions in the block become valid - executed. The node that found the valid hash is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. This process is also known as mining, and the node is a miner. In addition to the newly mined Bitcoins, the successful node also receives transaction fees from the transactions included in the block.\n\nTypically, a block contains around 2,500 transactions. The total reward includes a fixed number of newly mined Bitcoins plus the transaction fees. On average, one block is produced every 10 minutes.\n\nThe Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty of the hash, that is required to secure the block, to maintain these 10 minutes per block timing, regardless of how much computational power is available. Simply said, if the blocks of transactions are being generated too fast, the Bitcoin algorithm increases the hash difficulty, which in turn requires more computational power to guess the right hash and thus requires more time. Restoring the average 10-minute interval between blocks.\n\nAs of today, the mining reward is 6.25 BTC, and total fees per block range between 0.1 BTC and 1 BTC. To keep it simple, let's say that the total reward per block is 7 BTC.\n\nTo summarize: approximately every 10 minutes, a new block is created, containing around 2,500 transactions and giving the miner approximately 7 BTC in revenue.\n\nLet's do a thought experiment to show how the economics of Bitcoin mining and its energy consumption work. Imagine we have set up a mining operation big enough to consistently mine one block a day. For simplicity, we will assume our daily mining revenue is 7 BTC. Given Bitcoin's current valuation of $65,000 per BTC, our operation would bring around $455,000 in revenues daily.\n\nTo determine our profit, let's for the sake of an argument assume a 20% profit margin. This is a reasonable assumption given the competitiveness of Bitcoin mining. If profits were significantly higher, it would attract more miners, increasing the network's computational power. This influx would increase the mining difficulty, as Bitcoin's protocol adjusts to maintain the average block time at ten minutes, consequently diminishing profit margins. Conversely, if mining was less profitable, miners would exit the industry, reducing competition and difficulty. Those who would remain could enjoy higher margins.\n\nWith 20% being our profit margin, the remaining 80% are our operational costs. These are costs for energy consumption and hardware amortisation. Simplifying further, we can assume that the bulk of hardware expenses ultimately translates into additional energy consumption, considering the energy required to mine, transport and transform natural resources to the required hardware. For simplicity, let's thus say that 80% of the mining reward is spent on energy consumption.\n\nOur operations would then every day collect revenue of $455.000, earn $91.000 of profit, and spend $364.000 on energy.\n\nExpanding our analysis to the entire Bitcoin network, which generates approximately 144 blocks daily (24 hours x 6 blocks per hour), we find that the collective daily revenue for all miners amounts to around $65.5 million. Correspondingly, energy expenses sum up to approximately $52.4 million, which translates to about $19 billion annually in energy costs.\n\n$19 billion worth of electric energy a year? Is this too much? In an era where billions are routinely cited in media reports, consider Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, we might become indifferent to such large and abstract numbers. The tendency is to rationalize these enormous figures as justified for a system as significant as Bitcoin.\n\nYet, these costs are ridiculously high when put into perspective. Consider the energy cost per transaction: If an average block encapsulates about 2,500 transactions, with each block incurring $364,000 in energy expenses, the cost per transaction amounts to $145. This expense is extraordinary, especially when considering that Bitcoin, a non-physical asset, could ostensibly cost more to move digitally than sending a physical package across continents.\n\nWhile individual users don't directly bear the full $145 transaction fee, since it's offset by the creation of new Bitcoins, effectively diluting the currency pool, the energy consumed remains real. To offer another comparison, this amount far exceeds what some modern digital banks spend to serve a customer for an entire month, which costs to serve around $1. (check NU Holdings 2023 Q4 Earnings Call Presentation)\n\nLooking ahead to Bitcoin's future, let's reference a prediction from ARK Invest's CEO.\n\nIf we adapt our model to this scenario, even as the block reward declines due to halving (to 1.56 BTC per block by 2030, rounded up to 1.6 BTC with the transaction fees), our mining operation's revenue per block would grow to $2.4 million, and our daily energy costs soaring to $1.92 million for our single operation. Extrapolating to the entire network, this would result in daily revenues of $345.6 million and energy costs of $276.5 million. $101 billion worth of energy is spent annually!\n\nAt $0.05 per kWh, $101 billion equates to approximately 2,018 TWh of electric energy. To provide context, according to Statista, net electricity consumption worldwide in 2022 amounted to around 25,500 TWh. Thus, if Bitcoin hits Cathie Wood's forecasted price of $1,500,000 by 2030, its energy consumption would constitute about 8% of worldwide electric energy production. Should Bitcoin reach this price point earlier, say by 2028, its energy usage would escalate to 16% of global production, factoring in Bitcoin halving effects. One might wonder if Cathie Wood actually understands the implications of her forecast.\n\nThe relationship between Bitcoin's price, the revenues earned by miners, and the energy consumed are direct: as the price increases, so do miners' earnings and consequently, their energy expenditures. When Bitcoin's price reaches sufficiently high levels, it could potentially monopolize affordable energy resources, diverting them from other vital economic and societal needs. Persisting in this energy-intensive endeavour is foolish under any circumstances, but especially so in the context of looming ecological crises. To amplify such a ""doom spiral"" when facing potential environmental collapse is unmistakably self-destructive.\n\nLet's now examine if empirical evidence aligns with the conclusions of our thought experiment.\n\nFirst, we refer to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which estimates the annual power demand of the Bitcoin network at current Bitcoin prices to be 163 TWh, with a theoretical upper limit of 394 TWh. Translated into dollars at $0.05 per kWh, this equates to a range of $8 billion to $24.7 billion. The results of our thought experiment, where we estimated yearly energy consumption worth $19 billion, fall within the upper range provided by the University of Cambridge. Particularly since our experiment considers the total energy footprint, including the energy input in hardware manufacturing, whereas Cambridge's figures predominantly account for operational energy usage.\n\nFor additional insights, let's turn to the Bitcoin Mining Calculator, which assesses the profitability of various mining hardware setups it sells.\n\nSome devices show profit margins as high as 80%, suggesting that only 20% of revenues are spent on electricity. At first sight, these numbers contradict our thought experiment's assumptions. However, this discrepancy can be attributed to two main factors.\n\nFirst, the most recent and efficient mining hardware can indeed temporarily achieve higher profit margins for miners, but as this advanced hardware becomes the standard, the network's overall mining difficulty adjusts, normalizing profit margins. With the increasing mining difficulty, the efficiency of specific hardware declines over time, aligning long-term profitability more closely with the 20% margin hypothesized in our experiment rather than the initial 80% figure. Eventually, the hardware's profit margin becomes negative, and the miners dispose of it.\n\nThe second factor is Bitcoin's price volatility. The Bitcoin price is currently spiking, and price surges enhance miners' revenue without increasing operational costs, thus inflating short-term profitability. However, as the network adapts to these changes through more miners joining the fray and consequent increased difficulty, profit margins normalize. Conversely, a rapid decline in Bitcoin's price can render mining temporarily unprofitable.\n\nIn summary, the empirical data largely corroborates the premises and outcomes of our thought experiment. While specific circumstances or cutting-edge hardware can temporarily boost profitability, the long-term economic equilibrium of Bitcoin mining tends towards a scenario where a significant majority of mining revenue, around 80% or more, is allocated to energy costs.\n\nEnergy Innovation Feedback Loop Argument: Bitcoin advocates often say that energy innovations will mitigate Bitcoin's excessive energy consumption. However, imagine a breakthrough that would bring 10 times more energy at 1/10th the costs. What would this do to our hypothetical mining operations? Initially, our mining costs would drop to 8%, boosting our profits to 92%. Yet, this would attract more miners, intensifying competition and increasing the mining difficulty. Ultimately, the network's energy consumption would multiply 10 times to balance out the reduced costs. Bitcoin, by design, requires that significant resources are consumed (wasted) as proof in its proof of work algorithm. So no matter how abundant or cheap some energy source might be, Bitcoin will consume so much of it, as to make the spent significant in respect to Bitcoins price. Otherwise, the security of its proof of work consensus mechanism can't be guaranteed.\n\nGreen Energy Argument: There are indeed Bitcoin mining operations using renewable energy. This doesn't inherently negate the broader environmental impact. Renewable energy used for mining is energy not used elsewhere in the economy, serving more critical and essential needs. Bitcoin advocates would argue that these mining operations are in remote regions, where there is no other use for the energy. This is also wrong. It fails to consider global energy dynamics and the transportability of energy-intensive processes like data centres, particularly the very recent and power-hungry AI or the emerging direct CO2 air capture technologies.\n\nMore Efficient Hardware Argument: As we have discussed in the empirical evidence section, the newest Bitcoin mining hardware always appears quite efficient and shows a mining profit margin of around 80%, which leads many people to believe that as newer devices get introduced, Bitcoin mining will become more efficient and will consume less energy. This is the wrong conclusion. The newest hardware is only comparatively efficient, and as other miners upgrade to the same or better hardware, the network difficulty increases, and a particular piece of mining hardware becomes less efficient. Again, Bitcoin's design mandates that significant resources are consumed (wasted) as proof in its proof of work algorithm. Bitcoin's mining can't be made efficient by design.\n\nBitcoin Comparison to Gold: Bitcoin is often compared to gold, with the conclusion that it is just like gold, only better. It is a digital asset, with all the benefits that come with it when storing and transacting it. Indeed, the similarities are quite stinking. But the analogy between Bitcoin and gold fails in at least one critical aspect. While both assets' mining costs are influenced by their market prices, gold retains its value independently of its mining status. You can stop mining gold and the value of the gold already mined will hold its value, possibly even appreciate more. Conversely, stopping Bitcoin mining would paralyse its network, stripping the currency of its value since transactions would no longer be processed. This critical difference underlines a fundamental flaw in treating Bitcoin as 'digital gold.'\n\nBitcoin's Unique Value Proposition: Bitcoin is often considered as one of its kind, pioneering cryptocurrency with a unique value proposition. When scrutinized, it's apparent that other cryptocurrencies, particularly those using proof of stake consensus algorithm, offer similar or better functionality without the environmental impact. For instance, Ethereum, with its proof of stake algorithm, consumes a stunning 28,000 times (yes, twenty-eight thousand times) less energy than Bitcoin (6 GWh vs. 170 TWh). Bitcoin's value is largely narrative-driven, supported by its status and market momentum rather than irreplaceable utility. Transitioning to less energy-intensive cryptocurrencies could yield similar benefits without the associated environmental costs.\n\nBitcoin Reward Halving Argument: The halving of Bitcoin rewards is considered a future solution to its environmental impact. However, this argument overlooks the fact that Bitcoin's value has historically risen faster than the halving rate, maintaining or even increasing the incentive for energy-intensive mining. Relying on an asset whose environmental impact depends on its price not growing too rapidly presents a paradoxical situation, especially when the asset is supposed to serve as a store of value.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin ETFs: Investors concerned about Bitcoin's energy consumption might assume that buying a Bitcoin ETF is not a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain itself and therefore does not contribute to Bitcoin energy consumption. As we have shown in this article, this is a wrong conclusion. Purchasing a Bitcoin ETF directly affects Bitcoin's price, and as we have seen, Bitcoin's price is the single most important factor linearly driving Bitcoin's energy consumption.\n\nBitcoin's energy consumption increases dramatically with its price: at $65,000, it consumes around $52 million worth of energy daily. Should its value double to $130,000, the daily energy spent doubles to $104 million. At a valuation of $1,500,000 by 2030, these costs would be $276 million daily or $101 billion annually. This would represent around 8% of the world's current annual electric energy consumption.\n\nMany Bitcoin investors might not fully understand that its energy consumption scales linearly with its price. Such a characteristic is undesirable for a digital currency and counterintuitive for an asset meant to serve as a store of value. In their quest to preserve and grow their wealth, Bitcoin investors are unintentionally inflicting damage on the very fabric of society that bestows value upon their assets. This scenario strikingly resembles the fate of Easter Island's civilization: their relentless endeavour to erect moai statues ultimately caused both environmental degradation and societal downfall.\n\nEventually, it is likely that either investors or regulators will acknowledge this fundamental flaw in Bitcoin, potentially triggering a rapid devaluation.\n\nMy analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin is an unsustainable store of value and a technically outdated digital currency. Its long-term intrinsic value, considering these factors, will eventually trend towards zero. Each day, Bitcoin maintains a significant valuation that contributes to societal and environmental damage. Therefore, Bitcoin and its ETFs should get a ""strong sell"" rating.\n\nHowever, I understand that markets can remain detached from rational evaluations for extended periods. Most investors seek pragmatic and actionable advice rather than an idealistic appraisal. Hence, a ""sell"" rating is advised for pragmatic purposes.\n\nInvestors should gradually sell out of their Bitcoin positions, minimising regrets from missing on the current uptrend, and gradually shift their funds to different assets. If investors want to have exposure to cryptocurrencies, they should strictly avoid all the proof-of-work crypto coins.\n\nThe simplifications and rounding errors that I have made during the analysis do not materially alter the overall conclusions. Moreover, the thesis is supported by empirical evidence. Still, it is possible, that I have made an error in my reasoning. I encourage readers to critically examine my reasoning and identify any significant errors that could materially impact conclusions.\n\nThe other possible ""flaw"" could be a fundamental change in Bitcoin's protocol, such as a migration to a proof of stake consensus algorithm, similar to Ethereum's transition. But that would not be a flaw of this thesis but a positive development towards Bitcoin's sustainability. The question though is, how would such a transformation affect Bitcoin's value? Given Bitcoin's status as the 'first and true' cryptocurrency and its value being narrative-driven, a shift to proof of stake would probably trigger a significant devaluation.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,,,,,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1324841462/image_1324841462.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,null,0.3568627450980393,447881009,4

""This Biden all-electric mandate is by very, very stupid people.""\n\nThe former president was presumably referring to his successor's push to ramp up EV production to 60% of new vehicles by 2030. Those targets, announced last year, are reportedly being loosened thanks to lagging EV sales recently.\n\nThe Biden administration has also invested in billion-dollar efforts to strengthen the power grid and expand the availability of charging networks.\n\nTrump made headlines on Christmas for a post on Truth Social where he said that supporters of ""Electric Car Lunacy,"" among others, are ""THUGS"" who can ""ROT IN HELL."" Trump posted the message, which also mentioned ""No Energy Independence"" and the ""Green New Scam,"" as he lashed out against the criminal charges he faces.\n\nTrump met with Musk in Palm Beach, Florida, last week, as he looks to boost donations to his presidential campaign. Musk later said that he would not donate money to ""either candidate for US president"" -- though some are unconvinced.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Musk served on two presidential advisory councils but left after Trump elected to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that Trump's links to the oil and gas industry limited his support of EV manufacturers like Tesla during his presidency. Musk also claimed he voted for Biden, not Trump, in 2020 -- though, according to his biographer, he actually stayed home on Election Day. In May 2022, Musk said he planned on voting Republican in ""this election,"" but didn't specify if he meant the midterms or the 2024 presidential election. Later that year, he said he was undecided on whether he'd vote for Trump.\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from criticizing Musk in recent years. In 2022, Trump said the tech billionaire had come to the White House asking for help ""on all of his many subsidized projects,"" including his ""electric cars that don't drive long enough,"" his ""driverless cars that crash,"" and his ""rocketships to nowhere.""\n\n""I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,"" the former president said at the time.\n\nTrump on Monday acknowledged the United Auto Workers recently endorsed President Biden's campaign -- adding that union leaders were ""like blind sheep.""

More on that later.\n\nGiven the relative infancy of the shift towards an electric future, the means of achieving that end are likely to shift dramatically as technology improves and is overtaken.\n\nDebate still rages over whether hydrogen will be the fuel of the future or whether battery power will supply our energy needs.\n\nAnd within the world of batteries, a range of materials and technologies are vying for dominance.\n\nIt's highly likely no single technology will emerge as a universal solution. It could well be that hydrogen will power larger vehicles, ships and aircraft with batteries the best placed for passenger vehicles.\n\nBut the recent crash in the price of critical minerals has delivered a wake-up call to those who merely had assumed that lithium, nickel and cobalt will dominate the future and those who assumed the path towards a lower emissions future would be a straight line.\n\nA strange thing happened late last year.\n\nAmerican car buyers lost interest in electric vehicles and instead began switching back to hybrids, vehicles that use a combination of petrol powered internal combustion engines and electric motors.\n\nThe trend began about this time last year but really gathered pace towards the end of 2023 as this graph from investment bank Morgan Stanley shows. The red line shows fully electric vehicles started the year with phenomenal growth. By March, however, hybrids began a resurgence which continued through to the end of the year.\n\nUS consumers bought a record one million hybrids last year, a 76 per cent increase from the previous year when it appeared Americans had tired of the quarter century old technology and were making the jump to battery powered automobiles.\n\nWhile electric vehicles still account for about a million new car sales in the US, the growth sputtered in 2023.\n\nExactly why is difficult to pin down. Concerns about refuelling and the higher prices of battery powered vehicles dominate the reasoning. But it has been enough for some major producers either to scale back plans to fully convert to battery power or consider a longer term shift to hybrids.\n\nFord is talking about a dramatic increase in hybrid production while General Motors, which abandoned hybrids five years ago in favour of battery powered electrics, is mulling a re-run of its shelved hybrid technology.\n\nBoth Detroit majors appear flummoxed about which way to turn. They've been wedged between Tesla - still the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles - and Toyota which has embarked on a path to maintain internal combustion engines either through hybrids or hydrogen.\n\nThe trend back to hybrids has yet to take hold either in Europe or China. But if it becomes entrenched, even if solely in the US, it could be enough to derail projections about the medium term demand for minerals vital for battery production.\n\nOr it could just speed up the innovation behind battery design and production.\n\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Elon Musk's Tesla is still the king. But the crown is slipping.\n\nIt remains the biggest manufacturer of battery powered cars but only by a whisker. In January, it accounted for 17 per cent of global sales with Chinese giant BYD hard on its heels with 16 per cent and GM a distant third with 7 per cent.\n\nWhile growth is stagnating in America, globally sales continue to grow strongly with a 55 per cent increase in January compared with the previous January. China dominates demand with Europe bringing in the silver and the US lagging behind in third place.\n\nIn each region, Tesla maintained a dominant sales position in the first month of this year.\n\nWhile Musk outwardly portrays a disdain for investment markets, he is coming under pressure. At $US175 a share, Tesla's share price is less than half its 2021 peak when it traded at $US407.\n\nThat's eaten into his personal wealth. No longer is he the richest person strutting the planet. That title now rests with Amazon's Jeff Bezos.\n\nChip shortages, production delays and increased competition forced him to continuously slash vehicle prices throughout 2023, which ate into margins and earnings.\n\nThe price of Tesla's Model Y was 26 per cent lower in December than the start of the year, a trend that is likely to continue as Chinese manufacturers ramp up production of cheaper models for the home market.\n\nBut that US shift back to hybrids has also forced Musk's hand.\n\nTransport accounts for about 17 per cent of all Australian carbon emissions, making it the third biggest after coal fired electricity generation and gas.\n\nNot surprisingly, the recent changes to emissions standards on new cars relates directly to the climate commitments made by the Morrison government, resulting in a split amongst Australia's automotive lobby.\n\nTesla and electric vehicle rival Polestar both have left the organisation, arguing the group is running a campaign designed to impede the new standards.\n\nSimultaneously, a new front has broken out in the war against electric vehicles with a strong campaign among some sections of the media that electric vehicles require large amounts of energy intensive material for their manufacture and aren't as good for the environment as they make out.\n\nFurther arguments are that, because the batteries make the vehicles heavier, particle pollution from brakes and tyres are more intensive than in petrol cars.\n\nWhile those arguments have some merit, they ignore one crucial fact. Electric vehicles don't emit carbon dioxide, the key ingredient influencing climate change. And as the grid becomes less reliant on coal fired electricity generation, emissions from two of our biggest sources will be gradually reduced.\n\nNot all batteries are created equal.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two main types, Lithium ion and lithium-ferrous-phosphate. And just to complicate things, there are two main types of lithium-ion batteries, nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA).\n\nNMC batteries are the most popular because they have high energy density, and charge performance.\n\nBut there are questions over whether the reliance on such expensive and unsustainable materials can be maintained given the expected growth rates of battery powered vehicles. They also have a relatively short life cycle.\n\nNCA batteries use less cobalt and no manganese, replaced by more sustainable aluminium. But they have been waning in popularity from manufacturers as this graph below shows.\n\nThe battery that is gaining traction, particularly since 2021, is the lithium-ferrous-phosphate (LFP) model as shown by the orange bar. It's cheaper, longer lasting and catches fire less easily. But it's heavier and still relies upon lithium.\n\nImportantly, it has no cobalt, nickel or manganese.\n\nAnd that's where the debate over the future of critical minerals gets interesting. The rapid shift in battery technology in the past decade is likely to continue.\n\nIf LFP batteries continue to gain momentum, what was believed just a few years ago to be the need for copious quantities of nickel, may evaporate and make the recent nickel bust look like a mild correction.\n\nThen there is lithium. Vast amounts of cash have been invested in the search and production, including a 50 per cent investment lift last year.\n\nSince 2018, China has been on the hunt for lithium supplies to feed its appetite for electric vehicles, snapping up half the lithium mines on the market while the US government has been determined to counter Beijing's efforts with massive subsidies and investment.\n\nBut even its future as a critical mineral may be limited. Already, Chinese manufacturer BYD is building LFP batteries using sodium instead of lithium with plans to install it in its low cost Seagull model.\n\nLonger term, an even greater threat looms. Work is underway on solid state batteries, that are lighter, longer range, faster charging and with less fire risk.\n\nThey may be here as early as 2030. Which could burn a hole in the critical minerals boom completely.",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,,,,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9156af23dfd0c06b4178dbf59267d389?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3375&cropW=6000&xPos=0&yPos=616&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,eng-9383890,-0.043137255,447880823,1

Beginning in 2014, Apple developed a plan that would diversify revenue and chart a future beyond the iPhone in one full swoop: an electric vehicle.\n\nThere were two main schools of thought about how to proceed:\n\nA. Build an electric vehicle with autonomy features similar to what Tesla was doing. That meant a car that could drive itself on freeways and some roads, but not everywhere.\n\nB. Change the world with a full-blown self-driving vehicle capable of taking passengers from point A to point B with zero intervention from a driver. Oh, and while doing all that, make it look like nothing seen before.\n\nApple & The Road Not Taken\n\nApple picked the second approach, a decision that meant the project was doomed from the start. Back then, everyone thought self-driving cars were just around the corner, metaphorically speaking. Elon Musk was the primary promoter of autonomous cars, but many other automakers were hooked on the idea. Why?\n\nMoney, gentle reader. At around that time, a Volvo engineer, in an unguarded moment, bragged that self-driving cars would be a license to print money for manufacturers. Why sell a car once when you could profit every day from selling subscription services that would allow cars to drive themselves? People would surely be willing to pay for such convenience.\n\nGurman says Apple was feeling pretty cocky in 2014. It had just upended the cellphone, tablet, and music industries. It was about to launch the Apple Watch, which it thought would crush the Swiss watch market. Apple wanted to do the same thing for cars.\n\nWith that in mind, Apple decided its car, in addition to offering advanced levels of autonomy, would break new ground when it came to what a car should look like. It could be a showcase for its vaunted Jony Ivy-inspired design language and be fully integrated into its ecosystem of products, which meant it would be hugely profitable for Apple.\n\nCleanTechnica readers will recall the tussle between Elon Musk and Tim Cook back in those days before production hell and cheap cars from China were just clouds on a distant horizon. Elon once crowed that Apple was where former Tesla engineers went to die. Then in the dark days when it seemed like Tesla might not survive, Tim Cook refused to take Elon's phone calls when Musk was frantically trying to find a buyer for Tesla.\n\nBusiness is not always about the triple net bottom line. Often it is just a good old fashioned game of King of the Mountain, or what a friend of mine refers to slyly as a ""d*ck measuring contest.""\n\nWhen the decision was first made to pursue an Apple car, it seemed like the automotive market would be the next battleground for Silicon Valley, especially in the area of autonomous cars. It was also clear that cars were essentially becoming computers on wheels.\n\nThe world of personal transportation seemed like a category ripe for disruption, one that could be transformed with a smartly packaged combination of hardware, software, and services. The company could design the coolest looking car on the road, develop its own underlying operating system, and sell services on top of it -- services like self-driving features, Apple Music, and TV+ video streaming.\n\nBy the time Apple realized its mistake a few years ago, it was too late, Gurman says. All the design work had focused on a car meant to have no steering wheel or pedals. The company also had sunk billions of dollars into developing a Level 5 self-driving system. The die was cast.\n\nA source inside Apple told Gurman it was as if Apple had tried to skip all the early iPhone models and jump right to the iPhone X. Instead of just planting a flag in the ground with a good car featuring an Apple user interface, slick Jony Ive-designed interior and exterior, and an iPhone-like buying experience, the company bet everything on the wrong horse -- autonomy.\n\nIndecision In High Places At Apple\n\nProject Titan, the code name Apple choose for its iCar venture, was beset by indecision and disagreement and technological challenges from the start. And that was before the cold hard realities of what it takes to actually manufacture automobiles kicked in.\n\nTim Cook and other executives disagreed on what strategy to pursue, including whether to build a car at all, but also on minutia like what gee-whiz gizmos should be included in the car's interior. A major point of contention was what level of autonomy to give the car. The scale ranges from 0 to 5, and Apple's goals shifted several times throughout the project. At the same time, prospects for the overall EV market dimmed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, scrapping Apple's car project wasn't a mistake, especially since it frees up resources to focus on new generative AI features. But it's still a massive disappointment that will alter the course of the company's history, perhaps for decades to come.\n\nA Dymaxion For The 21st Century\n\nAccording to sources, the Apple car design in 2020 resembled the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle -- a futuristic van with rounded edges that reminds many people of the ill fated but groundbreaking Dymaxion created by Buckminster Fuller -- the inventor of the geodesic dome -- in 1933. Unlike the Canoo, the Apple concept had dark black windows with an adjustable tint. There was an all glass sunroof, a pure white exterior, and whitewall tires with a black center. The front and back were identical, so it would always look like you were driving forward. It looked like no other mass-produced vehicle -- and was optimized for full, Level 5 self-driving.\n\nThough the car's interior changed several times, the general idea was a minimalist interface, combined with seats you'd normally see on a private jet or a limousine. Inside, it felt like you were essentially in a ""contoured bubble,"" the sources said. This version of the car could comfortably accommodate four people with the seats being able to convert from being normal chairs to recliners complete with foot rests.\n\nMany of the interior designs included a giant TV in the center to show videos and handle FaceTime. Other variations added iPad-sized displays suspended from the roof to access frequent controls. Apple even went as far as devising a special air conditioning system that would push the flow of air along the sides of the cabin like airplanes do rather than being projected into the faces of the passengers.\n\nAn early design created by the legendary Jony Ive looked like a modern reincarnation of the original Volkswagen microbus -- which itself bears more than a passing resemblance to the Buckminster Fuller Dymaion. That concept was known internally as the Bread Loaf. The second concept design looked nearly identical to the 2017 Volkswagen ID.Buzz prototype.\n\nThat design was shown off inside Apple well before VW ever announced its concept, and that may not be a coincidence. Gurman says some employees left the Apple car group for the German automaker in the mid-2010s. A third variation of the Apple car kept the same overall design, but had a far more dramatic front -- like a wedge pointed downward.\n\nThe fourth version was the model that looked more like the Canoo and brought fresh excitement to the project in 2020. Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams were so impressed with the design that they gave a speech at Apple's test track in Arizona and committed to push headlong into development.\n\nThe car's last major design, which was still a variation on the original Bread Loaf idea, swapped the van-like sliding doors for rear doors similar to the falcon wing doors featured on the Tesla Model X. Even more so than with prior iterations, it wasn't designed for a traditional driver. It featured a front and back with such dramatic pinched curves that there was little room for front or rear windows.\n\nWhen Apple ultimately decided to switch from Level 5 autonomy to something more like Level 2, it needed to add back a steering wheel and pedals as well as front and back windows. By the end, the car had two seats facing forward that could swivel, something that was extremely popular in the vans Detroit manufactured in the 70s.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMy old Irish grandmother might say that Apple was too clever by half. The Apple car project was driven partly by ego -- the desire to beat Elon Musk and Tesla to the goal of manufacturing an automobile that could drive itself. As mentioned above, that goal is mostly about generating revenue for corporations. The allure of all those profits have blinded many corporations to the main goal of the EV revolution -- getting millions of electric cars on the road so emissions from driving are substantially reduced.\n\nIf Apple wants to get into the car business, it could buy an existing company like Rivian or Canoo or form a partnership with an automaker the way Sony has done with Honda. It has enough cash on hand to buy just about any company it wants, including Tesla.\n\nApple made a decision to pursue autonomous cars a decade ago. As Robert Frost wrote in a poem more than a century ago, Apple decided to take the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,steve_hanley@cleantechnica.com,Steve Hanley,author,FALSE,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apple-Car-Tesla-Model-3-CleanTechnica-Watermark-1-scaled.jpeg,eng-9383743,-0.129411765,447880606,6

It also has a tendency to have its wheels ripped off, and has repeatedly gotten ensnared by mild hazards like a sandy beach.\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claim that the vehicle's thick, stainless steel exoskeleton is bulletproof comes with some notable caveats. As YouTuber Zack Nelson from his channel JerryRigEverything found out in a recent video, rounds of a variety of sizes have no trouble at all penetrating the steel.\n\nWhether any of that even matters in the first place is another debate entirely -- after all, who in their right mind needs their pickup to be bulletproof? Besides, attackers could simply target the vehicle's windows instead, which are far more vulnerable.\n\nTo be fair, a .50-caliber gun, the biggest round tested out by Nelson in his video, is a ludicrous uncommon weapon -- and a lot more powerful than the Tommy gun Musk unloaded on a Cybertruck late last year.\n\nBut even smaller rounds like the .17 Hornady Mangum Rimfire round, which travels at over 2,000 feet per second -- roughly twice the velocity of a handgun round -- made it past the stainless steel, Nelson found. An AR round that travels at over 3,000 feet per second also pierced both the stainless steel and the Cybertruck's interior door panel.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the much larger .50 caliber round had zero issues either.\n\n""I can see through the truck from here,"" Nelson said in his video before examining the half-inch hole in the truck's door. ""That's wild.""\n\n""Still, slowing down a bullet is still infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle,"" he concluded.\n\nSo there we have it.

Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behaviour could prove legally pivotal.\n\n""If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,"" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot. Tesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill declined to comment. Anderson did not respond to requests. Both have left Tesla. McNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Anderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNearly 1000 crashes\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of US accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use.\n\nThe agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts. The fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving. ""There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,"" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves. It disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up ""enhanced"" Autopilot, which costs US$6000 ($9078), adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features.\n\nThe US$12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'Ready to take control'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law.\n\nThe former Tesla president's message, he said, ""corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles"".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript. Reuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behaviour.\n\nAfter a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n""Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,"" he said. ""It is not the neophytes.""\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions. Autopilot might make an ""unexpected steering input"" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver ""is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake"".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n""I'm not aware of any research specifically,"" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n""I cannot,"" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLulled into distraction\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: ""Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.""\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n""The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,"" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman. ""I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.""\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers ""adhere to their continuous driving responsibility"".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading US product-testing companies.\n\nIts road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n""Autopilot usually does a good job,"" Funkhouser said.

So, that being the case, that $66,000 to $16,000 crash. That shook out the tourists. That shook out the nonbelievers. When it was 16,000, we were all ready to ride it to zero.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nMicroStrategy has amassed more than 193,000 tokens over the past several years, making it the largest institutional holder in the world. At the time of writing, the tokens are worth nearly $14 billion.\n\nSaylor also discussed the differences between buying MicroStrategy shares and some of the recently approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He said that MicroStrategy shares allow you to hold Bitcoin in an ""accretive"" manner, as they are using loans to continually buy more. MicroStrategy recently announced that it was selling $700 million of convertible notes to buy more tokens.\n\nAdditionally, Saylor noted that the fees charged by the ETFs, usually around 0.25%, are unattractive. While this could be a smaller point to Bitcoin maximalists, or those who simply want exposure to Bitcoin alone, Saylor noted that MicroStrategy is essentially ""giving you a yield on your shares"" through its combination of Bitcoin holdings and business operations.\n\nMicroStrategy has performed extremely well, up over 650% in the past year. However, it is important to note that Saylor is incentivized to paint MicroStrategy shares in the best way possible, as he holds over 200,000 shares, worth over $300 million.\n\nTrending: Bitcoin To $100,000? Here's what gold bug Peter Schiff said could happen on Anthony Pompliano's podcast.\n\nSaylor also compared Bitcoin to other assets, such as gold, bonds and real estate, because it is digital and ""you can trade it a million times faster than conventional assets."" He also mentioned that it trades 24/7, is a global currency and that it is decentralized and useful.\n\nIn addition, Saylor mentioned that the halving could be a further benefit to Bitcoin in terms of price. He says that Bitcoin has ""no negative catalysts"" because it is decentralized and doesn't have cash flows. Additionally, he mentioned that the halving could reduce the amount of selling activity, as the miners would have less BTC to sell each day. According to Saylor, the halving will reduce the amount of Bitcoin mined each day from 900 to 450.\n\nSaylor also discussed the underlying business operations of MicroStrategy. Though it is a software company, Saylor said that he is hoping to rebrand as a ""Bitcoin development company"" that uses the operating cash flows from the software business to fund more Bitcoin purchases.\n\nSaylor closed the interview by urging viewers not to think of Bitcoin as a currency, but as ""digital property; a billion-dollar building in cyberspace ... the killer application is capital preservation for everybody.""\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nRead Next:\n\nLarge boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets -- has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump told the hosts. ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: ""I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\n""But,"" he went on to say, ""you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too."" Some American companies, he charged, are ""not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.""\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls ""countries of concern,"" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,"" he wrote. ""They are a true Enemy of the People!""\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.",berkshireeagle.com,news,The Berkshire Eagle,associated_press@berkshireeagle.com,Associated Press,author,FALSE,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/d4/9d4f448b-984e-59c9-93d6-6f994525115f/65ef400441798.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,null,-0.011764706,447880486,1

Members of Beyond the Wall Investing get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate. Learn More ""\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the largest U.S. companies in terms of stock market capitalization. However, in recent months its share price performance has raised doubts among investors whether it is still reasonable to hold the laggard:\n\nAfter looking at various sources and doing my analysis, I believe that TSLA stock has already entered a buy zone where its price can be considered reasonable for the potential business growth shareholders are set to receive over the next few years. So, I think investors should gradually start to form a long book in TSLA or hold the stock if it is already in their long-term portfolio.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to explain the sources I used for this, my first article about Tesla Inc. They are Goldman Sachs' November 2023 report, RBC's February 2024 industry research report, Barclays' comments on the fourth quarter of FY2023 results, Morgan Stanley's TSLA stock outlook for FY2024 (December 2023), and Argus Research's January 2024 report. All these sources are proprietary, which I would like to emphasize right at the beginning - this fact forces me to refer to the analyzed information in a special way, without publishing individual fragments of the reports, in order to avoid copyright infringement. Of course, I use the latest 10-K, press releases, and management comments as well as other publicly available sources. So let me start with the public information first.\n\nBased on the press release, in Q4 2023 Tesla produced ~495,000 vehicles and delivered ~484.5 thousand vehicles, which is about 12.75% and 19.5% higher than last year, respectively. The company's revenue increased by 3.49% YoY, and the gross margin - one of the main metrics all investors are keeping a close eye on - experienced a YoY slump of 613 basis points. On a QoQ basis, however, the company's GP margin only fell by 26 b.p., which can be considered a good result under the current macro conditions and against the backdrop of growing competition in the world of EVs.\n\nAccording to Barclays' report, the consensus margin for Q4 2023 was at ~17%, so Tesla's actual gross margin surpassed the market's expectations, indicating that the GP margin is past the trough now. So with progress being made in the development of the Model 2 (Tesla's next-generation vehicle) and a more concrete timeline for the start of production (expected in 2H 2025), excitement in the market could increase, the analysts add.\n\nIndeed, last quarter Tesla saw a 3.4% QoQ reduction in vehicle cost per unit, dropping to around $36,000/unit due to volume growth (i.e., better fixed cost absorption), lower raw material costs, and potentially higher IRA benefits. But Barclays expected an ongoing ASP compression amid tough pricing conditions, with a forecasted 4% QoQ ASP reduction in 1Q FY2025. While Tesla aims to maintain pricing discipline in 2024, competition may force further price cuts. This was said at the end of January, and by mid-February Tesla reduced prices again, making Barclays' forecast come true:\n\nBut as far as I can see, this is not unique to Tesla. According to RBC's report, there's currently no evidence yet that the EV market slowdown is reaching its nadir. This is evidenced by Ford Motor Company's (F) worsening EV losses in Q4 FY2023 and its FY2024 guidance, which is worse than expected. General Motors Company (GM) reported modest BEV sales in FY2023 (though beating consensus), selling 170,000 units, with a forecast to sell 250,000 this year. For reference, compare it to Tesla's 1.8 million deliveries in FY2023 and consensus expectations of 2.1 million for FY2024. We learn even more about the quality of the currently deteriorating EV landscape from Magna International Inc. (MGA), which has moved its breakeven guidance for megatrend investments from 2025 to 2026, citing the ongoing EV slowdown as a major factor. Aptiv PLC (APTV) has also lowered its long-term gross operating margin forecast from 8-10% to 6-8%, citing the decline in the high-voltage business, a segment driven by EVs.\n\nOverall, I don't expect electric vehicle manufacturing - now TSLA's biggest revenue pot - to be the company's main focus going forward. Years of electric vehicle development and the rapid growth of the financials of the pioneers have attracted so many firms and start-ups wanting a piece of the pie that the overall EV market going to get oversupplied very soon (if not already), according to a study by Redburn Atlantic (proprietary source):\n\nElon Musk is, as far as I can tell, a mission-driven person. If many years ago, when he was just starting to build Tesla, he wanted to solve the environmental problems associated with the proliferation of ICE vehicles, then in the current conditions of oversupply that goal seems almost achieved. Next, he's likely to shift focus to AI, full self-drive (""FSD""), robots, clean energy markets, and improving existing EV software.\n\nTesla needs a business model change, and I agree with Nick Colas, who said in a recent interview with CNBC that TSLA should consider a $10 billion to $15 billion capital raise to drive its transformation from an automaker to a disruptive technology company. I do not presume to judge the appropriateness of this figure, but according to Nick this should be sufficient, and for a company as large as TSLA such a capital increase is more than possible.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla does not have to give up on defending its current market leadership in the EV market when such a transition is imminent. The company has to seek to develop infrastructure, services, and related products and constantly expand its offerings. One of the company's projects - the Supercharger Network - is expected to become a major revenue driver in the coming years as many automakers, including Ford, GM, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have agreed to adopt the Supercharger charging standard (NACS) in their electric vehicles by early 2024-2025, according to analysts at Argus Research. This will allow owners of these vehicles to use Tesla's Superchargers, which are the largest fast-charging network in the world with 5,952 stations at the end of Q4 2023.\n\nSo even though the recently reported slower growth in both vehicle deliveries and EPS creates an overhang on the stock in the short term, I believe that Tesla is well positioned for longer-term growth given its leading position in the EV, cleaner energy markets; the tailwinds from other projects like robots add some upside to this story.\n\nTalking about the company's valuation today, Tesla's PEG ratio for next year of 2.89x may seem very high to many - especially compared to the sector median of 1.55x. And in general, we see no signs of undervaluation in the overall picture of Tesla's valuation multiples:\n\nBut let's look at this picture from a slightly different angle. What if we were to look at TSLA as a full-fledged technology company and not just a car company? Then, given its size, we have to compare it to other ""Magnificent 7"" companies. What do we see? Tesla stock appears to be extremely overvalued on a price-to-earnings ratio basis:\n\nHowever, if we use the long-term growth potential of the companies as a comparison and then also compare it with the implied P/E ratios, we now see that TSLA is becoming one of the most undervalued stocks in the peer group:\n\nIn other words, this graph can be described as follows: If an investor chooses between buying TSLA and other mega-caps, buying Tesla stock today will give him/her the highest earnings per share growth rate at a roughly average implied P/E ratio.\n\nOf course, there is a high risk that the market's current view of EPS will change dramatically in 5-6 years. Therefore, the current growth rate may be a bit too high. But if my assumption about the rapid repositioning of the company from a pure car company to a full-fledged tech giant over the next few years comes true, then by the logic of things we will see a slower contraction of the multiple. This means Tesla is likely to maintain its high multiples for longer than currently expected - which bodes well for good total returns over the next few years.\n\nSpeaking of concrete figures: If we assume that Tesla's P/E ratio is in the 25-30x range by FY2030, then at the current consensus earnings figure of $10.92 per share, the stock should get to the mid-range of ~$300. That equates to a total return of about 71.3%, giving a CAGR of 10.48% over the next 6 years.\n\nWhile I remain optimistic about Tesla's growth prospects, some risks should be carefully weighed before you make any investment decision.\n\nFirst, the ongoing slowdown in the electric vehicle market combined with intensifying competition is challenging Tesla's dominance and market share. So pricing and margin pressures exacerbate these concerns and may impact profitability given competitive pricing dynamics.\n\nSecond, the transition to a disruptive technology company poses risks as Tesla will need to make operational adjustments and investments to expand its offering - this is where the execution risks come in. Also, the absolute valuation metrics raise eyebrows about potential overvaluation as the macroeconomic factors add complexity to Tesla's growth trajectory, killing the valuation premium (i.e., the multiple keeps shrinking faster, which is not good for the stock price).\n\nThis is why every existing or potential investor must keep a close eye on industry trends and the dynamics of the competitive landscape. Tesla's gross margin over the next few quarters must show that it has bottomed out and is ready to stabilize and eventually rise. It's also important to look at the non-EV segments and their health - from what we've seen in Q4 2023, everything is going well so far. But whether this trend will continue in the future is a big question.\n\nWhen you buy a stock like Tesla, you're buying a ticket to the future, so to speak. It's very important that this ticket does not expire. From what I see today, Tesla's ""ticket"" is still valid: the company continues to develop in different directions and is actively trying to ride several waves at once. I don't think multitasking will hurt the company in the long run; on the contrary, it's a great way to expand and diversify the business structure and gain a foothold in new, promising end markets. The most important thing in this case is to have a visionary at the helm who has the ability to take on several tasks at once. Elon Musk's entire biography shows us that this is just one of those cases.\n\nI see today's difficulties in TSLA price action as an excellent opportunity to take a long-term position, which may have to be averaged down, but which I calculate should yield more than 10% annually by 2030 even at today's prices.\n\nI'm therefore rating the stock a ""Buy"" for the first time today.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,oakoff_investments@seekingalpha.com,Oakoff Investments,author,FALSE,https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1768680938/ru/%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE/bletchley-england-spacex-x-and-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-speaks-with-members-of-the-media-during-day.jpg?b=1&s=594x594&w=0&k=20&c=Q1JRT_4FY07qgORzvZdBN8nOpCVa40T8dHjxXDz3aAo=,null,0.2,447880330,4

In promoting his companies on social media in 2018, Musk stated on X, ""There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week."" Ironically, a few years later, average employees find themselves working more than 40 hours.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMusk's hardcore work ethic has sparked considerable debate and criticism over the years. During Tesla Model 3's production peak, Musk's commitment saw him working 120-hour weeks, missing personal milestones and resorting to insomnia medication to manage sleeplessness. His method of dividing the day into five-minute increments illustrates an intense drive to optimize every moment for productivity, a trait admired by some but seen as unsustainable by others.\n\nThe tech industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, has long celebrated this intense work culture, often blurring the lines between work and personal life. Engineers and entrepreneurs are known to forgo traditional meals for efficiency, embodying a lifestyle where work predominates every aspect of life. Such dedication has led to innovations but also raised questions about the sustainability of such a lifestyle.\n\nMusk's attempt to apply the same hardcore work philosophy at X, demanding employees to commit or resign, resulted in a significant staff departure, indicating a potential misalignment between his work ethic and workforce expectations.\n\nContrary to Musk's belief that long hours are essential to achieving success, research and historical evidence suggest that longer hours don't necessarily equate to higher productivity or better job performance. Studies have found that increased work intensity and prolonged hours can impair work quality, lead to decreased alertness and reduce overall workplace productivity.\n\nTrending: Around 56% Of Americans Feel Behind On Saving For Retirement - How much does somebody need to stay on track?\n\nA recent Slack survey of over 10,300 employees globally found that pressuring employees to work after hours leads to lower productivity, more work-related stress and decreased job satisfaction. Those who chose to work extra hours of their own accord reported slightly higher productivity and wellness scores, highlighting the importance of autonomy and employee choice in work hours.\n\nThe assumption that world-changing work requires excessively long hours is also challenged by the historical example of Henry Ford, who found that reducing the workweek improved productivity in his automobile factories. This finding supports the notion that shorter work hours can enhance efficiency and output, a counterintuitive result in a culture that often celebrates the burn-the-midnight-oil mentality.\n\nDespite the negative impact, more Americans are working 40-plus hours out of necessity. According to a 2021 Gallup survey, the average full-time employee works about 44 hours per week, with roughly 41% working 45 or more hours. This statistic highlights a trend where many work beyond the traditional 40-hour workweek not just to change the world but to make ends meet.\n\nForbes reported that the U.S. is the most overworked country in the developed world. American workers log more hours annually compared to their counterparts in several developed countries, such as Germany. The average work year in the U.S. encompasses about 1,750 hours, which is 400 hours more than what German employees work annually.\n\nFor those feeling the strain of overwork, managing your finances differently could be a key to relief. Consulting a financial advisor could open up strategies for making your money work harder for you, potentially easing the need for long hours. Advisers can explore avenues for savings, investments and retirement planning, aiming to secure a future where working past retirement age isn't a necessity. It's a step toward not just enduring work but ensuring work and savings pave the way to a more balanced life.\n\nRead Next:\n\n""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Elon Musk Once Stated, 'Nobody Ever Changed The World On 40 hours A Week' -- But Now The Average Employee Works 44 Hours Per Week Just To Make Ends Meet originally appeared on Benzinga.com",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

In return, OpenAI said that Musk wanted to combine the company with Tesla and become its CEO in old emails. Now, let's hop on to the recent development.\n\nElon Musk shared this update via a post on X, however, he didn't delve into many details. According to him, the Grok chatbot could open source this week. At the same time, he fired shots at OpenAI. ""OpenAI is a lie,"" he replied to a user. Open sourcing the code of Grok means that developers could access and modify the code which could open doors for creativity. Among many who reacted to this post is Nothing CEO Carl Pei who called this move, ""Based"" and Perplexity boss Aravind Srinivas who reacted with a salute emoji.\n\nGrok is accessible exclusively for those users who have subscribed to Premium+ on X. Musk, once referred to Grok as ""based and loves sarcasm."" He reiterated that Grok has ""little humor in its responses.""\n\nMusk's companies have a history of open-sourcing codes for users. Tesla, for example, made its patents public ten years ago, and now many car makers use its electric vehicle charging connector. Another Musk venture, X, released the code for its ""For You"" algorithmic feed last year, but it didn't reveal much.\n\nMeanwhile, The Wall Street Journal points out Musk might be thinking that by allowing other developers and researchers to explore Grok's code, more people will use the model.

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump told the hosts. ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\nPeople are also reading...

""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: ""I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\n""But,"" he went on to say, ""you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too."" Some American companies, he charged, are ""not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.""\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls ""countries of concern,"" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,"" he wrote. ""They are a true Enemy of the People!""\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Facilities in California and Texas were used for animal testing on monkeys, along with other animals, to progress Neuralink's technology. The issues documented by FDA include findings from the California facility, noting that no such issues were seen at its Texas facility.\n\nFDA reportedly visited the facility last year from June 12 to 22 - representing the agency's sole inspections of the company's facilities on record. Inspectors identified a litany of problems at the site, including missing calibration records for instruments such as a pH meter used in one of the studies and, for another study, seven instruments including a vital signs monitor which had no record of having been calibrated. Additional issues at the facility included quality assurance officials not signing off on the final study report or documenting any deviations from approval protocols or standard operating procedures.\n\nCurrently, FDA has not issued a designation detailing the severity of problems found at the inspection, according to the agency database. Reuters, who first broke the news of the report, wrote that according to experts, ""While the problems identified are serious, they do not appear to be significant enough to justify the FDA's worst inspection designation, which would prompt action.""\n\nThe agency routinely conducts inspections after human trial approval and before commercial approval to ""assure data integrity and reliability"", along with compliance with accompanying FDA regulations, Carly Pflaum, an FDA spokesperson, told Reuters.\n\nNeuralink, which obtained FDA approval in May 2023 to start human trials for its implantable, cited its animal research data in the application to the agency. Just last month, the company reported that its first human patient had been implanted with the brain chip and appears to have fully recovered. The patient, according to Elon Musk, CEO of Neuralink, in a Spaces event on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, is able to control a computer mouse using their thoughts.\n\nExperts have questioned why FDA had not inspected Neuralink before giving approval for its in-human trails since concerns about its animal subjects have been reported since 2022. The agency has jurisdiction to conduct such an inspection before permitting a company to begin its clinical trial and has done so before in other cases.\n\nVictor Krauthamer, a former long-time FDA official, told Reuters, ""It would have made sense for the FDA to have conducted the inspection before human trial approval. These are violations of fundamental requirements that you don't want to worry about happening again in the human trial.""\n\nPrevious allegations\n\nThis, however, isn't the first time Neuralink has been on the wrong side of animal-welfare violation allegations. MD+DI reported in December 2023 that the company was being accused of animal suffering and death during its research into the brain implant. An exclusive Reuters report revealed multiple internal staff complaints that animal testing was being rushed, resulting in needless suffering and death of its testing animals.\n\n""Some complaints stated that Elon Musk, the CEO of Neuralink, was pressuring employees to accelerate development despite resulting botched experiments,"" according to previous MD+DI reporting. ""These failed tests would have had to be repeated, 20 current and former employees told Reuters, increasing the testing and subsequent killing of more animals.""\n\nAdditionally, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group, filed a complaint with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in early 2022, alleging that the company was mistreating its animal subjects and causing unnecessary animal deaths. Neuralink denied these allegations.\n\nThe USDA did, however, opt to open a probe into Neuralink's treatment of animals at the end of 2022.\n\nIn an email to MD+DI at the time, USDA Office of the Inspector General wrote, ""USDA OIG neither confirms nor denies the existence of any such investigation. We have no comment.""\n\nIn summer 2023, an update from Secretary Thomas Vilsack in a letter to Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer stated that the agency had not found violations at the facilities apart from a company reported incident in 2019. It was further noted that more inspections were planned.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nThe FDA report detailing the problems at Neuralink's California facility has sparked renewed concern over company transparency.\n\nIn an article by Forbes, industry experts raised questions about Neuralink's blasé approach to communicating scientific news, and the ethicality of not registering its implant trial on ClinicalTrials.gov -- a public database in which most clinical trials are registered for transparency and accountability.\n\nNeuralink's dissemination of important information usually comes from social media posts on Musk's X platform rather than traditional peer reviewed publications, or repositories, which Marcello Ienca, a professor of ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich, told Forbes, ""Seems to sidestep the established protocols that underpin scientific integrity,"" and prevents experts from evaluating the full scope and impact of claimed advances.\n\nAdditionally, while not illegal for the company to not have registered its clinical trial on ClinicalTrial.gov, Ienca said not doing so ""violates fundamental ethical guidelines for biomedical research."" Specifically, she cited the Declaration of Helsinki, a cornerstone statement of ethical principles for medial research involving humans. Neuralink has not communicated to the public that it has set up any internal ethics board or code of ethics and has not engaged in any major activities from policy organizations like OECD, according to Forbes.",mddionline.com,news,MDDI Online,,,,,https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/bltd98070d43f2ee295/65ef52e2f2e490040a7619a4/FDA_Breakthrough_Device_Designation_(43).png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,null,-0.145098039,447879759,4

The shoes, which sold out quickly for $399 per pair, could be bought with Bitcoin.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the shoes in an interview on CNBC: ""Sometimes we'll let people pay through Bitcoin ... it's an additional form of currency"".\n\nThis statement was huge coming from the former president, who has said that Bitcoin is a disaster waiting to happen in 2021. His stance has changed since then. According to Trump, ""Bitcoin has taken on a life of its own"" and he ""can live with it one way or the other.""\n\nTrump seems to be going even further by letting people buy his shoes with Bitcoin. The action accepts that Bitcoin is ""an additional form of currency,"" a huge change from his past stance on crypto.\n\nTrump has been in conversations with former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is pro-crypto and has endorsed Trump. The conversations were centered around the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which Ramswamy is against. He pointed out the potential harm it could cause Trump. In turn, Trump promised to ""never allow"" CBDCs, showing that he values Ramaswamy's opinion on crypto.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also discusses crypto projects he is involved in, saying that he ""does little things for fun"" and ""make[s] money with it."" While this does not mean that he directly bought Bitcoin, it is likely a reference to the Trump Digital Trading Cards non-fungible token (NFT) project. Trump collected trading royalties on the project, amassing a stash of over 1,400 ETH. Trump sold 1,075 of those tokens for $2.4 million.\n\nTrending: If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here's how much you'd have today.\n\nThough Trump was not directly involved in the NFT project, he was directly involved with the shoes, which seemed to garner a lot more attention. According to Trump, the last pair of shoes, which were a special edition, sold for $450,000. ""People were going crazy for these sneakers. You probably were, too. Everybody was,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump also added that ""so many [of the sneakers] were paid for with the ... cryptocurrency."" Bitcoin was created to be a store of value and a form of payment. However, it has struggled to get mainstream adoption in terms of transactional use. The former president offering the ability to pay using Bitcoin could open the floodgates in this regard.\n\nHowever, Trump also noted that he ""would not allow countries to go off the dollar, because when we lose that standard, that will be like losing a revolutionary war."" Trump may be OK with Bitcoin but don't expect it to overtake the U.S. dollar if Trump wins the presidential election in November.\n\nBitcoin breached the $72,000 level and set new all-time highs on the morning of the interview, up nearly 5% on the day.",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,,,,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEE0A01Z_L.jpg,eng-9384516,0.058823529,447879581,1

Plus it's now battle-tested and battle-hardened, especially against Western weapons,"" he said.\n\nMusk appeared to agree with Sacks, commenting on the post on X: ""Unfortunately, this is true.""\n\nCiting the size of Russia's army compared to Ukraine's, Sacks stated that Biden has ""created"" a much more ""formidable"" Russian military. Meanwhile, it's the US that has seen its stockpiles ""depleted and hollowed out,"" he argued.\n\nThe economic sanctions on Russia have become another major miscalculation of Biden's policies, according to Sacks. He believes that the idea to ""crush"" Russia with sanctions was delusional as the country's economy stabilized and even outperformed G7 economies in 2023.\n\n""The Russian economy is growing faster than any of the G7 economies. It's really booming and it's our European allies' economies that have been crushed by the sanctions,"" he noted.\n\nBut it is Ukraine that has been suffering the most from US involvement in the conflict, he argued. He attacked Biden who claimed that the US would ""help ease the suffering of the Ukrainians"" but in fact, Washington's support ""of this proxy war and our willingness to fight to the last Ukrainian"" has led to a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""\n\nThis is not the first time the two men have been in alignment on such issues. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with Sacks' statement on X that NATO ""faced an existential crisis"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union and decided to embark on an expansion spree to fill the void.\n\nThe US has been Ukraine's primary backer and has provided over $111 billion in military and financial assistance. However, in recent months, US aid has subsided drastically as the administration of President Joe Biden has struggled to overcome Republican resistance to its efforts to push through another $60 billion for Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has said that the US and its allies who continue to arm Ukraine cannot prevent Russia from achieving its goals and are only prolonging the suffering of Ukrainians.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,,,,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/MGY3NzUzYWMtYzR.jpg,eng-9385267,0.058823529,447879402,1

It hasn't earned all the fees Morgan Stanley was counting on. And like the collective of other banks that loaned Musk a total of $13 billion to buy Twitter, Morgan Stanley has been stuck holding onto the loans it made, unable to sell them off because Twitter's decline has reduced the debt's value.

What has President Biden been doing in the unusual amount of time he spends without anything on his schedule? By his own words, we know he is counting the number of potato chips and other snack foods in a bag -- and by golly, he has promised to stop this product shrinkage and punish the greedy food companies.\n\nA small potato chip company operating with a modest margin finds that, due to general inflation, costs have risen sharply for potatoes, vegetable oil, rent, machinery, labor, etc. Facing this problem, the company can either raise prices or reduce the amount of product in a bag and continue to sell it at the old price. Businesses learned there is often less consumer resistance to a reduction in portion size than a price increase -- so fewer chips per bag. But in the end, it is the same thing -- the consumer is paying more per chip. The president calls this ""shrinkflation."" He should know; he caused it.\n\nMr. Biden often acts as if inflation came from the tooth fairy (or ""greedy businessmen"") rather than as a result of the actions and policies of his own government. Among Mr. Biden's many misstatements (in perhaps the worst State of the Union address ever) was his claim that U.S. inflation is ""the lowest in the world."" In fact, China, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and the whole euro area, among other jurisdictions, have lower inflation rates.\n\nPoliticians have complained about high prescription drug prices for decades, noting that many pills cost relatively little to produce. What they are choosing to ignore or don't understand is the difference between average and marginal cost.\n\nThe research and development costs for many drugs run into tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Most drugs have limited markets in that not many people have the specific disease or conditions that the drug treats. The marginal production cost of a drug may be only $5 per pill, but the average cost (to cover research and development and Food and Drug Administration approval) per pill may be $700, causing consumers and politicians to scream about high drug prices.\n\nMr. Biden and many other politicians are demanding price controls -- which have failed virtually every time they have been tried. No rational pharmaceutical company will spend huge amounts of money developing new, lifesaving drugs if it cannot recoup full development costs. This is basic economics that the political class chooses to ignore -- but those who die because of the lack of new drugs no longer vote.\n\nThe president proposed many new spending programs and subsidies for favored constituencies. Almost all politicians do this to a greater or lesser extent while ignoring how to pay for it. Most governments are well above optimum size -- meaning that at some point, almost all spending programs no longer meet a cost-benefit test (many of them never did). And many cost-benefit studies ignore the acquisition costs of obtaining the funds.\n\nMr. Biden claimed that the ""rich and corporations"" will pay his spending programs. Politicians have been making this claim since at least the introduction of the income tax in 1913 -- and of course, it never happens. Mr. Biden and the other big taxers keep up the refrain about wanting the rich to ""pay their fair share"" while refusing to address the basic question of what a fair number is.\n\nOne of the problems with trying to tax the rich is that they and their capital can move. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently stated that her tax base had moved to Palm Beach. Surprise, surprise -- people move from higher to lower tax jurisdictions, which happens between U.S. states and countries.\n\nMany studies are showing that the high marginal tax rates do not bring any added income to governments (people have legal and illegal ways of moving income and wealth). High tax rates, however, discourage capital investment, job creation and economic growth. Billionaire Ken Griffin and his Citadel Fund recently moved to Florida from Illinois. Already, he has made many large investments in Florida, along with huge donations to various Florida charities. The amount of benefit from businesses Mr. Griffin, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and the other super-rich create and charities they support in their chosen locales is many times the direct tax that any government could expect to get from them.\n\nMr. Biden has been saying for more than four years that no one making less than $400,000 a year under his proposal will pay one penny more in taxes -- but after inflation, $400,000 is already down to about $350,000 in purchasing power. In an inflationary environment, such promises don't mean much.\n\nMr. Biden's home state of Delaware has favorable tax and regulatory rules for corporations, greatly benefiting the state -- which Mr. Biden has defended and bragged about. Pension funds own a large percentage of many American corporations whose profits fund retiree pensions.

In a video that was uploaded on Friday, Nelson shot the electric pickup truck with a series of guns, including an AR-15 and .50-caliber rifle.\n\n""Nothing is actually bulletproof. There's always going to be a bigger bullet, but today we are going to see scientifically where that line gets drawn,"" Nelson said in the video.\n\nThe Cybertruck was able to survive shots from a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber rifle which left small dents in the metal. However, Nelson noted the truck's metal cracked if the shots landed too close together on the metal.\n\nThe truck took on more damage, however, when Nelson brought in some faster weapons, including a .17-caliber rifle, as well as an AR-15 and .50-caliber gun. The video from the .50-caliber gun shows the shot flying through the car door -- which Nelson left open to avoid damaging the truck's interior -- and taking a nickel-sized chunk out of the metal. The metal also cracked all the way through when Nelson fired the .223-caliber AR-15 at the vehicle.\n\nWhile the truck didn't prove entirely bulletproof, Nelson said he was still impressed by its durability.\n\n""The truck is still in one piece,"" Nelson said in the video. ""There's a few ventilation holes now, but, overall, I am very satisfied with how bullet -resistant the Cybertruck is. It works on 9 millimeter, .22. Anything faster than that and there's gonna be a hole, but still slowing down a bullet is infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle.""\n\nNotably, a .50-caliber rifle is an incredibly high-powered weapon. A single round from a .50-caliber Browning Machine Gun could ""knock down hovering helicopters, penetrate armored limousines,"" according to The Small Arms Review.\n\nAn auto expert previously told InsideEVs, that the Cybertruck will likely be able to deflect weapons that have a lower velocity like a pistol or a Tommy Gun, but it won't be able to withstand faster weapons, like a .223 AR-15. -- which can fire bullets at a speed of around 3,000 feet per second, more than three times as fast as a Tommy Gun. (During the vehicle's delivery event in November, Tesla also shared a video of the truck surviving a round of bullets from a .45-caliber Tommy Gun.)\n\nNelson and a spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the Cybertruck was first announced in 2019, Musk has hyped up the rugged nature of the truck, claiming the vehicle would be entirely bulletproof.\n\nWhen Musk first revealed the Cybertruck in 2019 he attempted to demonstrate the vehicle's ""armor glass"" windows by having Tesla's design boss throw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window. At the time, the glass immediately broke on contact with the metal ball. Musk later said on social media that a prior test had compromised the window.\n\n""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door.""\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan in 2023, Musk said that the standard Cybertruck wouldn't have bulletproof glass, but the stainless steel doors would still be thick enough to stop a bullet. Musk said Tesla would also offer a version of the truck with thicker fixed-pane glass windows.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,,,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7UzYYuz_4Cw9jfSIzW8xFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/18ca1f7f3973f17e97aa5944ea537ab9,eng-9385104,-0.207843137,447879033,1

I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nThe call happened before markets opened Monday morning, and subsequently, Meta shares fell 4%, and at one point were trading down 5%.\n\nAs for TikTok, Trump said ""there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad"" on the platform. ""There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" he said.\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook suspended Trump's accounts on the grounds that he incited a violent insurrection on January 6th, and used both platforms to celebrate that violence and spread the lie that he won the 2020 election.\n\nTwitter's ban on Trump was indefinite, however after Elon Musk took the company over in 2022 he reinstated Trump's account along with those of other alt-right and fringe personalities who had been suspended for various reasons. (And, late last year, Musk also reinstated the account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, despite years of his damaging lies about the Sandy Hook massacre.)\n\nFacebook's Oversight Board ruled that indefinite bans were wrong, and the company ultimately decided to suspend Trump's account for two years -- or until he no longer posed ""a threat to public safety,"" which, arguably, he still does.\n\nTrump got his accounts back by early 2023, but he hasn't been back on Twitter, opting instead to ""tweet"" on Truth Social, though his audience there was never as large as his Twitter following.\n\nHe, or members of his campaign, have been fairly active on Facebook, though, posting videos from his live appearances and putting out calls for volunteers.\n\nHe still seems to have a grudge against the company, though, and he'd likely do his best to make life difficult for Meta if he were to become president again.\n\nMeta, so far, has not commented on Trump's remarks.",sfist.com,news,"SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports",,,,,https://img.sfist.com/2024/03/trump-pout-win-mcnamee-getty.jpg,eng-9380150,-0.341176471,447878938,1

He added that any action harming TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called an ""enemy of the people.""\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,"" Trump said. ""There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.""\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\n""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok,"" he added, ""but the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\nTrump tried to ban TikTok while in office, pushing its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform to a new owner or face being blocked from U.S. app stores. A House committee advanced legislation last week that would similarly force TikTok to cut ties with ByteDance.\n\nIn a powerful display of bipartisanship -- rare these days in Washington -- the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party used nearly identical language to describe the risks of TikTok.\n\nThe Republican chair, Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, said that ""America's foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States."" And his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, said TikTok ""poses critical threats to our national security"" as long as it is owned by ByteDance.\n\nBut as the bill was under consideration, Trump said last week on Truth Social, his social media platform, that ""if you get rid of TikTok,"" it would double Facebook's business. He said he did not want Facebook ""doing better."" Trump was banned from Facebook the day after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, and reinstated early last year.\n\nThe full House is expected to vote on the legislation Wednesday. President Joe Biden said last week that he would sign the measure into law if it reached his desk.\n\nTo support his ""enemy of the people"" claim, Trump singled out grants that Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, made in 2020 to state and local election offices to help their administration of voting during the pandemic. Trump suggested that Zuckerberg, whose website was part of the Trump 2016 campaign's strategy for victory, should face prison time for those donations.\n\nTrump also claimed that Facebook was every bit as beholden to China as TikTok. Facebook is blocked in the country and attempts by its parent company, Meta, for a return have been unsuccessful. The company has taken steps to sell its virtual reality headsets there.\n\nThe CNBC interviewer asked Trump about suspicions that he had been ""paid off"" to change his view on TikTok after a meeting with a major TikTok investor, billionaire Jeff Yass.\n\nTrump and his team are working frenetically to find new major donors as he heads into a general election against Biden, who, along with allied groups, has much more money behind him.\n\nTrump met this month with the world's second-richest man, Elon Musk, and at a recent event hosted by the conservative group the Club for Growth, Trump reportedly praised Yass as ""fantastic."" The Club for Growth recently had a rapprochement with Trump after many months of a freeze.\n\nYass, who has previously been a harsh critic of Trump's, appears to have had his own change of heart. An official at a pro-Trump super political action committee declined to say whether Yass had donated money to the outside group, but a person close to the campaign said the Trump team expected a significant donation from Yass to one of the outside groups backing the former president.\n\nYass has funded a major advocacy drive in Washington to stop the banning of TikTok. He and his allies have recruited several former Trump administration officials to help with the effort -- including Tony Sayegh, who was a Treasury official, and Kellyanne Conway, who was a senior counselor to the president.\n\nIn the CNBC interview, Trump denied discussing TikTok with Yass at their meeting.\n\n""No, I didn't,"" Trump said, saying it had been a brief meeting with Yass and his wife. ""He never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump's criticism of the new legislation is striking because of his move to restrict the company while in office. An executive order he signed in August 2020 said that TikTok's data collection from its users ""threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."" It added that TikTok could be used to spread disinformation that benefited Beijing.\n\n""These risks are real,"" the executive order said.\n\nTrump's administration moved to block Apple's and Google's app stores from carrying TikTok over concerns about the app's Chinese ownership. But federal courts ruled repeatedly to block Trump's TikTok ban from taking effect.\n\nByteDance seemed to reach a deal to sell a stake in TikTok to Oracle, a cloud computing company whose executives had ties to Trump. The acquisition never came to fruition as the legal challenges to Trump's ban made their way through the courts.\n\nTrump acknowledged in his CNBC interview that well-paid lobbyists were shaping how the government handles TikTok.\n\nCongress, Trump said, is ""extremely subject to people called lobbyists, who happen to be very talented, very good and very rich.""\n\n""I could have banned TikTok,"" he added, ""I had it banned just about, I could have gotten it done. But I said, 'You know what, but I'll leave it up to you.'""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,,,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AODMHmrJDTNYDjJAWZq8.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/7a1439401119bdc0c46b286dad647b6f,eng-9380150,-0.192156863,447878770,1

Co-founded by LGBTQ+ activist Eric Cervini; his partner, Adam Powell, a noted drag performer; and celebrity cross-dresser RuPaul, Allstora was created to be an ""independent bookstore committed to sharing all stories and sharing profits fairly.""\n\nNot only did Cervini, Powell, and RuPaul initially insist on giving authors a higher share of the profits from their books, but they also took a hard stance against censorship. ""At Allstora, we believe that the censorship of any book, perspective, or story is incompatible with the survival of democracy,"" its website said as recently as March 6. ""We cannot fight the ideologies of hate if we lack the ability to study, understand, and react to them.""\n\nThat ""decision to carry all books"" angered many leftists, especially those who identify somewhere along the LGBTQ+ spectrum. LGBTQ Nation railed that Allstora dared to carry books written by ""anti-LGBTQ+ extremists,"" such as the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh; Chaya Raichik, better known on social media as Libs of TikTok, whom LGBTQ Nation called a ""hate monger""; and Abigail Shrier, described as ""transphobic."" Others objected to Allstora selling books by former President Donald Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nAllstora tried to quell their concerns by flagging certain titles that ""are contrary to our core values."" The store even promised to donate all proceeds from sales of those titles ""to fight book bans.""\n\nBut the leftist onslaught continued unabated, and Allstora folded to pressure within days. On March 9, Cervini released a full-page statement that chronicled his rapid transition from anti-censorship advocate to mob apologist.\n\n""We envisioned a bookstore that split its profits with all authors: not just queer and trans storytellers, but also Black, Brown, disabled, neurodiverse, everyone,"" Cervini wrote. ""A place where all the infinite intersections of humanity could find their books, their people.""\n\n""As a historian, I understood that even the most hateful of books can have educational value,"" he continued. ""I knew that to dismantle prejudice, we must examine its illogic. We must study history so as not to repeat it, and we must understand hatred if we are to destroy it.""\n\nBut in his attempt to understand his enemies, Cervini said he soon realized that he had unwittingly created an ""unsafe"" platform where ""queer or trans youth"" might ""accidentally stumbl[e] upon a harmful book.""\n\n""I confused my duties as an academic and a bookseller, and I brought pain instead of joy into the world. And for that, I am sorry,"" he said.\n\nCervini then noted that ""the most harmful books"" had been removed from Allstora's catalog and invited shoppers to ""continue to report any instances of hateful material on our site.""\n\n""As we continue to grow, I'm committed to doing a better job of listening and learning from the communities that we hope to nurture.

This strategic move follows a report by Fortune detailing X's plans to roll out a TV app for Amazon and Samsung users in the coming week.

In the wrong hands, it could prove disastrous\n\nThe technological revolution once promised a new era of expanded democracy and enhanced opportunity. Instead, we face today a reality that blends the worst aspects of George Orwell's Big Brother and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World controllers.\n\nDon't believe me? Look to the launch of a recent version of Google's Gemini AI, which produced black and female versions of Vikings, the founding fathers and even Nazi soldiers as historically correct. While comical for some, this showed not only the tech giant's casual incompetence, but also a deep-seated desire to reinvent reality along progressive lines.\n\nIt also reflects deeply entrenched bias in Google's development team, who appear to see it as their mission to reshape society, and even the past, to fit their predilections. Gemini was ambivalent when asked whether Elon Musk or Adolph Hitler had a more negative effect on society - hardly the sort of reasoning one would expect from the supposed technology of the future.\n\nIf this was an isolated case, we could all enjoy a good laugh about the latest Californian lunacy. But this is hardly a one-off. Even before AI, staffers at Google, Facebook and Twitter share what could be likened to an ideological hivemind, curating content in a way some conservative lawmakers have suggested is discriminatory towards Right-wing views.\n\nFormer employees have suggested these companies algorithms intended to screen out ""hate groups"", even though programmers often have trouble distinguishing between ""hate groups"" and those who might simply express dissenting but legitimate views.\n\nMost dangerous of all, these big tech firms have become giant oligopolies with almost unlimited funds and a net worth greater than Canada, Russia, South Korea, Australia and Spain combined. Nor can we expect these firms to be tempered by traditional market capitalism.\n\nGoogle and Apple account for nearly 90 per cent of all mobile browsers worldwide, while Microsoft by itself controls 90 per cent of all operating system software. Perhaps more ominously, two-thirds of the world's cloud services - essential for AI - are controlled by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nThese geeky bad boys are essentially capturing not just the means of communication but control of content as well. They are becoming what Aldous Huxley called ""a scientific caste system"". People like Jeff Bezos may see this as the ""beginning of a Golden Age"", but it seems closer to what the French analyst Gaspard Koenig describes as ""digital feudalism"".\n\nAI looms as a force multiplier for these oligarchs. Already nearly two-thirds of US adults now get their news through social media like Facebook or Google. This is even more true among millennials, soon to be the nation's largest voting bloc. Although the Gemini project is now being re-evaluated, we inevitably face AI bots that are more subtle and persuasive, particularly for a generation that reads little and knows even less.\n\nRather than an upsurge a new plucky start-up, AI technology seems better suited to expanding the oligarch's stranglehold. They can tap enormous financial interests such as pension and sovereign wealth funds, who have provided upwards of $7 trillion in capital for new high-end chips and the development of ever more complex and sophisticated algorithms, even as global cash for new, smaller firms is at the lowest ebb in five years.\n\nThe inherent dangers of the AI data revolution are clear. China already employs a digitally enabled ""social credit"" system to track citizens' activities. There's even an app that rewards people for reporting signs of dissent to authorities, such as illegal publications. Christina Larson, a MIT researcher, asked the right question: ""Who needs democracy when you have data?""\n\nWe may find out. China's surveillance system is more omnipresent, centralised and brutal, but the digital dictatorship does not need to be cloaked in red. As we saw from the botched Meta (the parent company of Facebook) response to allegations over Hunter Biden's laptop, Silicon Valley has the power to shape potentially election-defining news stories.\n\nAs they gain more access to our health, financial and personal data, our new controllers reach for ever more soft power. It's hardly scaremongering to suggest that hyper-monitoring could create a situation wherein people could be arrested on the basis of algorithmic predictions of violence: such a proposal has already been championed by the Trudeau regime in Canada, a nation once renowned as a staunch defender of civil rights.\n\nCarl Sanburg once wrote of the Chicago fog coming in ""on little cat's feet"". The same imagery applies to Big Tech: it doesn't need loud ranting speeches, military parades or late-night banging at your front door.

The ARC-IM stimulator then captures the decoded information to precisely stimulate the spinal cord. The combination has already provided positive results in providing movement for the paralysed lower legs.\n\nWhile the breakthrough device designation granted earlier this month will help with a prioritised application, the TAP programme will facilitate enhanced collaboration and support from the agency. Benefits range from earlier device risk mitigation to more timely premarket interactions.\n\nOnward Medical's CEO Dave Marver said: ""TAP enables us to reduce the time and cost to deliver the benefits of ARC-BCI to people living with paralysis.""\n\nOnward has completed two feasibility studies with the ARC-BCI system, demonstrating the technology's ability to restore movement in upper and lower limbs.\n\nThe company is set for a busy 2024, after announcing it is on track to submit a de novo application for its non-invasive neuromodulation therapy ARC-EX to the FDA. A submission is slated for the first half of the year.\n\nShares in the Euronext Brussels-listed company have risen sharply since the turn of the year following clinical and developmental milestones. The company is trading around 40% higher compared to the same time in January.\n\nA market model by GlobalData estimates that the global neuromodulation device market will be worth $11.4bn by 2033, up from $6bn in 2022.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known company developing neuromodulation is Elon Musk's Neuralink.

Instead, we face today a reality that blends the worst aspects of George Orwell's Big Brother and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World controllers.\n\nDon't believe me? Look to the launch of a recent version of Google's Gemini AI, which produced black and female versions of Vikings, the founding fathers and even Nazi soldiers as historically correct. While comical for some, this showed not only the tech giant's casual incompetence, but also a deep-seated desire to reinvent reality along progressive lines.\n\nIt also reflects deeply entrenched bias in Google's development team, who appear to see it as their mission to reshape society, and even the past, to fit their predilections. Gemini was ambivalent when asked whether Elon Musk or Adolph Hitler had a more negative effect on society - hardly the sort of reasoning one would expect from the supposed technology of the future.\n\nIf this was an isolated case, we could all enjoy a good laugh about the latest Californian lunacy. But this is hardly a one-off. Even before AI, staffers at Google, Facebook and Twitter share what could be likened to an ideological hivemind, curating content in a way some conservative lawmakers have suggested is discriminatory towards Right-wing views.\n\nFormer employees have suggested these companies algorithms intended to screen out ""hate groups"", even though programmers often have trouble distinguishing between ""hate groups"" and those who might simply express dissenting but legitimate views.\n\nMost dangerous of all, these big tech firms have become giant oligopolies with almost unlimited funds and a net worth greater than Canada, Russia, South Korea, Australia and Spain combined. Nor can we expect these firms to be tempered by traditional market capitalism.\n\nGoogle and Apple account for nearly 90 per cent of all mobile browsers worldwide, while Microsoft by itself controls 90 per cent of all operating system software. Perhaps more ominously, two-thirds of the world's cloud services - essential for AI - are controlled by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nThese geeky bad boys are essentially capturing not just the means of communication but control of content as well. They are becoming what Aldous Huxley called ""a scientific caste system"". People like Jeff Bezos may see this as the ""beginning of a Golden Age"", but it seems closer to what the French analyst Gaspard Koenig describes as ""digital feudalism"".\n\nAI looms as a force multiplier for these oligarchs. Already nearly two-thirds of US adults now get their news through social media like Facebook or Google. This is even more true among millennials, soon to be the nation's largest voting bloc. Although the Gemini project is now being re-evaluated, we inevitably face AI bots that are more subtle and persuasive, particularly for a generation that reads little and knows even less.\n\nRather than an upsurge a new plucky start-up, AI technology seems better suited to expanding the oligarch's stranglehold. They can tap enormous financial interests such as pension and sovereign wealth funds, who have provided upwards of $7 trillion in capital for new high-end chips and the development of ever more complex and sophisticated algorithms, even as global cash for new, smaller firms is at the lowest ebb in five years.\n\nThe inherent dangers of the AI data revolution are clear. China already employs a digitally enabled ""social credit"" system to track citizens' activities. There's even an app that rewards people for reporting signs of dissent to authorities, such as illegal publications. Christina Larson, a MIT researcher, asked the right question: ""Who needs democracy when you have data?""\n\nWe may find out. China's surveillance system is more omnipresent, centralised and brutal, but the digital dictatorship does not need to be cloaked in red. As we saw from the botched Meta (the parent company of Facebook) response to allegations over Hunter Biden's laptop, Silicon Valley has the power to shape potentially election-defining news stories.\n\nAs they gain more access to our health, financial and personal data, our new controllers reach for ever more soft power. It's hardly scaremongering to suggest that hyper-monitoring could create a situation wherein people could be arrested on the basis of algorithmic predictions of violence: such a proposal has already been championed by the Trudeau regime in Canada, a nation once renowned as a staunch defender of civil rights.\n\nCarl Sanburg once wrote of the Chicago fog coming in ""on little cat's feet"". The same imagery applies to Big Tech: it doesn't need loud ranting speeches, military parades or late-night banging at your front door.

Many more are hurriedly reconfiguring their policies, striving to avoid lawsuits from conservative activists as they attack diversity programs.\n\nThat's led to a flurry of requests for audits from law firms and consultancies who specialize on diversity in the workplace.\n\nTake Kenji Yoshino, a constitutional law professor at New York University and one of the country's leading experts on DEI. He says inquiries from Fortune 500 companies have surged since June, when the Supreme Court banned universities from using race as a factor in admissions and opened the gateway for legal challenges to corporate diversity hiring practices.\n\nHe's taking calls from a potential new client every week, and estimates he's presented to about 75 companies since last summer.\n\n""The appetite for this is just going through the roof,"" Yoshino said in an interview from his NYU office.

""There's a realization that whatever you say to an internal audience is going to be shared with external audiences.""\n\nStill, though the legislative landscape is uncertain, Schwartz said clients are looking for ways to continue their diversity efforts. Gibson Dunn is representing the Fearless Fund, a venture capital firm which is being sued over its grant program for women of color.\n\n""Right now, you need a lot of creativity and tolerance for risk,"" Schwartz said. ""All of the banks I have been talking to, their view is we are not going to overreact and abandon our programs. 'We don't want this place to look like it did in 1950. We want to do it in a lawful way but we're not going to run away from it'.""\n\nBloomberg News asked DEI experts to help explain the connection between the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action and what's next. Answers are based on interviews with experts including Yoshino and Schwartz, as well as articles written by law firms Duane Morris and Perkins Coie.\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court in June doesn't have a direct bearing on employer policy -- but it says a lot about where the court may go next. That's because rules governing discrimination in university admissions and in employment come from different parts of the same laws: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nCompanies have been allowed to recognize race as part of their employment selection criteria under rules governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (these are codified as part of Title VII in the Civil Rights Act). And the EEOC said that the court's June decision ""does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background.""\n\nStill, two weeks after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion, 13 state Republican Attorney Generals wrote to CEOs of the 100 largest U.S. companies, warning them that DEI policies could violate laws on racial discrimination.\n\nThe letter confirms that the Supreme Court's decision could accelerate challenges to a corporation's DEI efforts and that employers need to carefully evaluate whether their policies could face the threat of litigation, according to Gibson Dunn.\n\nExperts believe the court's views on race-conscious admissions will ultimately carry over in some fashion to corporate employment policies, and have been advising their clients to bring their DEI programs in line.\n\nYoshino says there are three criteria that can make a DEI program risky: 1) a preference for certain individuals over others; 2) when this preference is bestowed on a legally protected group: people of a certain race, color, religion, national origin or sex; and 3) when a policy relates to a palpable benefit like a job, pay rise or development opportunity.\n\nThough the exact boundaries may still be unclear, outreach efforts aimed at convincing more people of color to apply to positions aren't likely to raise red flags, but fellowship programs open only to minority candidates might. Similarly, calibrating compensation around diversity within a specific team could raise alarm bells while vaguer, company-wide goals might not.\n\nSo if a company policy says a manager will get more of a bonus because they have a racially diverse team, or if a fellowship exhibits a preference for a protected group such as people of color, then it is legally perilous, according to Yoshino.\n\nIf a company has unconscious bias training for everybody at the firm, then that's legally safe because it's not directed at a particular group and everybody goes through it, he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court may add a new wrinkle to laws around employment discrimination in June. It heard arguments late last year in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, a case in which a female police sergeant alleged that she was reassigned to a less prestigious role because she is a woman.\n\nThe City argued that the transfer couldn't constitute a violation of the Title VII anti-discrimination law because it wasn't significantly harmful to her as it didn't result in a change in her pay or title. The sergeant argued that the treatment was still damaging and unlawful because it was based on her gender. The justices seemed receptive to the sergeant's arguments.\n\nThe court may confine its judgment only to job transfers. But external lawyers say a wider decision could put companies at risk of an array of reverse discrimination suits for things that aren't currently deemed palpable benefits. For example, companies that offer mentoring or coaching opportunities only to members of a certain protected class might be at legal risk from someone who argues that not being included is damaging to them. A very broad ruling could discourage employers from offering any development or retention programs specifically for women or people of color.\n\n""As a practical matter,"" wrote lawyers for Duane Morris, companies should identify every program that makes such distinctions and ""either eliminate the exclusions or modify them so that they are not based on gender, race or other protected characteristics.""",whittierdailynews.com,news,Whittier Daily News,,,,,https://www.whittierdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-DEI-LAWYERS-GET.jpg?w=640,null,-0.129411765,447878340,1

Phillips willfully lied about a nine-year-old Chiefs fan wearing blackface.\n\nPhillips used a deceptive photo that showed only the side of the child's face painted black; not the entire photo showing the kid painted the other side of his face red in support of the Chiefs.\n\nThe author also stated that the boy ""hates black people and Native Americans.""\n\nDeadspin and Phillips doubled down on the smear, even after they had clearly lied. Not until 11 days later, when the family of the fan threatened legal action, did Deadspin correct the story.\n\nIn February, the family filed a lawsuit against parent company G/O Media alleging author Carron J. Phillips ""maliciously and wantonly"" attacked their son as part of a ""race-drenched political agenda"" to ""generate clicks.""\n\nWe spoke to a legal analyst about the lawsuit last month about how Deadspin ""cannot claim ignorance"" and is likely liable.\n\nPer Lexie Rigden, an attorney and frequent legal analyst for Fox News (check out her viral new column on the Kelce brothers):\n\n""Although defamation laws vary state by state, in general, to prove defamation, a plaintiff would have to show that a false statement was made (i.e. that this child is wearing blackface); that the statement was published to third parties (easy--it's all over the internet, with even Elon Musk commenting); that the defendant knew it was false or was at least was negligent in publishing it (Phillips and Deadspin saw the full photo and knew the context in which it was taken); and damages, that some harm was caused to the plaintiff's reputation (the death threats cited in the lawsuit).""\n\nThird parties re-published the false statement. Check.\n\nDeadspin and Phillips knew they printed a false statement. Check.\n\nThe kid and his parents endure damages by way of threats and harassment. Check.\n\nTranslation: defamation.\n\nZombie Deadspin also leaves behind a creature called Julie DiCaro, one of the slimmest writers on the internet. In fact, DiCaro recently filed her own lawsuit against G/O Media and Deadspin because she lost out on a promotion to a male.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that females are part of a ""protected class,"" and thus DiCaro has a pathway to sue under the guise of ""Title VII, the Equal Pay Act"" if a male is promoted over her.\n\nThe new company has already locked out DiCaro from the company Slack.\n\nIt's unclear what the European firm has planned for Deadspin.\n\nHowever, we can confidently surmise its plans cannot be worse than harassing children and employing slobs like Carron J.

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump told the hosts. ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: ""I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\n""But,"" he went on to say, ""you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too."" Some American companies, he charged, are ""not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.""\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls ""countries of concern,"" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,"" he wrote. ""They are a true Enemy of the People!""\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Many more are hurriedly reconfiguring their policies, striving to avoid lawsuits from conservative activists as they attack diversity programs.\n\nThat's led to a flurry of requests for audits from law firms and consultancies who specialize on diversity in the workplace.\n\nTake Kenji Yoshino, a constitutional law professor at New York University and one of the country's leading experts on DEI. He says inquiries from Fortune 500 companies have surged since June, when the Supreme Court banned universities from using race as a factor in admissions and opened the gateway for legal challenges to corporate diversity hiring practices.\n\nHe's taking calls from a potential new client every week, and estimates he's presented to about 75 companies since last summer.\n\n""The appetite for this is just going through the roof,"" Yoshino said in an interview from his NYU office. ""It's exponential and there's no end in sight.""\n\nThe executives are warding against conservative groups, who, emboldened by the court's decision, have been launching lawsuits and complaints against diversity programs across corporate America. DEI initiatives, they argue, amount to reverse discrimination and must be legally challenged. Billionaires Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have joined the cause, further amplifying the backlash over these programs.\n\nJason Schwartz, who runs a DEI taskforce at law firm Gibson Dunn, said he's also seen a huge volume of demand for legal counsel.\n\n""Lots of clients are wanting to do audits, review all DEI efforts, board diversity, socially conscious investing to assess risk and figure out what -- if any -- changes they want to make,"" he said. ""There is a never ending tide of stuff.""\n\nPublic relations professional Lindsay Singleton, who advises firms on their communications strategy around diversity, says clients who were never interested in strategizing on DEI before are now clamoring for research and advice on messaging.\n\n""Companies are revisiting their DEI programs and looking at them with legal to figure out: how do we protect ourselves, how do we talk about it?"" said Singleton. ""There's a realization that whatever you say to an internal audience is going to be shared with external audiences.""\n\nStill, though the legislative landscape is uncertain, Schwartz said clients are looking for ways to continue their diversity efforts. Gibson Dunn is representing the Fearless Fund, a venture capital firm which is being sued over its grant program for women of color.\n\n""Right now, you need a lot of creativity and tolerance for risk,"" Schwartz said. ""All of the banks I have been talking to, their view is we are not going to overreact and abandon our programs. 'We don't want this place to look like it did in 1950. We want to do it in a lawful way but we're not going to run away from it'.""\n\nBloomberg News asked DEI experts to help explain the connection between the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action and what's next. Answers are based on interviews with experts including Yoshino and Schwartz, as well as articles written by law firms Duane Morris and Perkins Coie.\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court in June doesn't have a direct bearing on employer policy -- but it says a lot about where the court may go next. That's because rules governing discrimination in university admissions and in employment come from different parts of the same laws: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nCompanies have been allowed to recognize race as part of their employment selection criteria under rules governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (these are codified as part of Title VII in the Civil Rights Act). And the EEOC said that the court's June decision ""does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background.""\n\nStill, two weeks after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion, 13 state Republican Attorney Generals wrote to CEOs of the 100 largest U.S. companies, warning them that DEI policies could violate laws on racial discrimination.\n\nThe letter confirms that the Supreme Court's decision could accelerate challenges to a corporation's DEI efforts and that employers need to carefully evaluate whether their policies could face the threat of litigation, according to Gibson Dunn.\n\nExperts believe the court's views on race-conscious admissions will ultimately carry over in some fashion to corporate employment policies, and have been advising their clients to bring their DEI programs in line.\n\nYoshino says there are three criteria that can make a DEI program risky: 1) a preference for certain individuals over others; 2) when this preference is bestowed on a legally protected group: people of a certain race, color, religion, national origin or sex; and 3) when a policy relates to a palpable benefit like a job, pay rise or development opportunity.\n\nThough the exact boundaries may still be unclear, outreach efforts aimed at convincing more people of color to apply to positions aren't likely to raise red flags, but fellowship programs open only to minority candidates might. Similarly, calibrating compensation around diversity within a specific team could raise alarm bells while vaguer, company-wide goals might not.\n\nSo if a company policy says a manager will get more of a bonus because they have a racially diverse team, or if a fellowship exhibits a preference for a protected group such as people of color, then it is legally perilous, according to Yoshino.\n\nIf a company has unconscious bias training for everybody at the firm, then that's legally safe because it's not directed at a particular group and everybody goes through it, he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court may add a new wrinkle to laws around employment discrimination in June. It heard arguments late last year in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, a case in which a female police sergeant alleged that she was reassigned to a less prestigious role because she is a woman.\n\nThe City argued that the transfer couldn't constitute a violation of the Title VII anti-discrimination law because it wasn't significantly harmful to her as it didn't result in a change in her pay or title. The sergeant argued that the treatment was still damaging and unlawful because it was based on her gender. The justices seemed receptive to the sergeant's arguments.\n\nThe court may confine its judgment only to job transfers. But external lawyers say a wider decision could put companies at risk of an array of reverse discrimination suits for things that aren't currently deemed palpable benefits. For example, companies that offer mentoring or coaching opportunities only to members of a certain protected class might be at legal risk from someone who argues that not being included is damaging to them. A very broad ruling could discourage employers from offering any development or retention programs specifically for women or people of color.\n\n""As a practical matter,"" wrote lawyers for Duane Morris, companies should identify every program that makes such distinctions and ""either eliminate the exclusions or modify them so that they are not based on gender, race or other protected characteristics.""",ocregister.com,news,The Orange County Register,,,,,https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-DEI-LAWYERS-GET.jpg?w=640,null,-0.043137255,447878158,1

Trumps primary concern lies in the potential growth of Facebook, which he perceives as an adversary, if TikTok were to be banned.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump expressed his opposition to banning TikTok, despite acknowledging its potential national security risks. In a recent interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Trump argued that prohibiting TikTok would inadvertently benefit its rival, Facebook, which he perceives as an adversary due to its alleged role in his 2020 election loss.\n\nTikTok's Popularity Among Younger Voters\n\nTrump acknowledged the popularity of TikTok, particularly among younger users, and expressed reservations about empowering Facebook further by eliminating its competition. He criticized Facebook's influence, particularly in the context of elections, and accused the platform of being ""an enemy of the people."" Trump's grievances stem from Facebook's substantial donations to non-profit organizations involved in election administration during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTikTok's Role in the 2024 Presidential Campaign\n\nTikTok has emerged as a significant factor in the upcoming 2024 presidential campaign, with its large user base of younger individuals. Despite expressing national security concerns and endorsing legislation that could lead to a ban, President Joe Biden's campaign officially joined TikTok last month. The bill, which passed unanimously by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee, calls for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its ownership or face a potential ban in the United States.\n\nTrump's Previous Attempts to Ban TikTok\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, citing national security concerns related to Chinese ownership. However, the courts blocked this action after TikTok filed a lawsuit, arguing that such measures violated free speech and due process rights.\n\nOngoing Concerns About Data Privacy\n\nTrump reiterated his belief in TikTok's potential national security risks, emphasizing the importance of protecting Americans' privacy and data rights. He also acknowledged similar concerns with Facebook and other companies, including American entities that engage in business with China. Trump suggested that these companies may be vulnerable to Chinese influence, posing additional national security risks.\n\nRecent Developments and Government Actions\n\nIn 2022, President Biden restricted the use of TikTok on devices owned by federal agencies, with limited exceptions for specific purposes. Additionally, he signed an executive order authorizing the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take measures to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to countries of concern, including China.\n\nAllegations of Data Sharing with China\n\nConcerns have been raised by the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission regarding the potential sharing of user data, such as browsing history, location, and biometric identifiers, between TikTok's owner, ByteDance, and the Chinese government.

Published in March 1944 during the Austrian economist's tenure at the London School of Economics (LSE), the book has been enduringly popular among free-market liberals.\n\nAmong its admirers was Winston Churchill, who as prime minister released 1.6 tons of precious war-rationed British government paper to allow additional copies to be printed. More recently Elon Musk tweeted a photo of The Road to Serfdom with the caption ""Great Book by Hayek"" to his 174 million followers, no doubt bringing Hayek's work to a new generation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Austrian is often seen by the left as an intellectual bogeyman, an enabler of unfettered greed, minimal social responsibility and soaring inequality.\n\nSo who was Hayek and why does The Road to Serfdom matter?\n\nHow laissez-faire fell out of favour\n\nBorn into an upper middle-class Vienna family in 1899, Hayek earned doctorates in law (1921) and political science (1923) at the city's university. He first made a name for himself in economics in 1928, publishing a report for his research institute employer that predicted the Wall Street crash of 1929 (some critics argue that his achievement gets exaggerated).\n\nHayek spent 18 years at the LSE (1932-1950), before moving to the University of Chicago (1950-1962). There he worked alongside Milton Friedman, another seminal advocate for free-market principles.\n\nThese views were profoundly unfashionable at the time. The social democrat consensus had been shaped by ""robber barron"" period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key industries such as rail and oil had been dominated by cartels and monopolies, leading to massive wealth inequalities.\n\nThen came the Wall Street crash and great depression, prompting a loss of confidence in economists and economic reasoning. Free-market capitalism took much of the blame. Socialism was offered as a realistic and even desirable alternative.\n\nProminent colleagues of Hayek's at the LSE, including political scientist Harold Laski and sociologist Karl Mannheim, believed socialist planning was inevitable in the UK. The Labour party explicitly warned in a 1942 pamphlet against a ""return to the unplanned competitive world of the inter-war years, in which a privileged few were maintained at the expense of the common good"".\n\nHayek disagreed. He thought this wave of popular ""collectivism"" would lead to a repressive regime akin to Nazi Germany.\n\nIn the Road to Serfdom, he accepted the need to move beyond the laissez-faire approach of classical economics. But he argued in favour of ""planning for competition"" rather than the socialists' ""planning against competition"" approach. He opposed the state being the sole provider of goods and services, but did think it had a role in facilitating a competitive environment.\n\nIn a central theme of the book, Hayek described the difficulties that democratic decision-making would face under central planning. He believed it would lead to policy gridlock and present opportunities for unscrupulous characters to become the key decision-makers.\n\nHayek's goal was to show that the British intelligentsia was getting it wrong. Socialist planning, he believed, would see citizens returned to the types of limited freedoms endured by serfs under feudalism.\n\nHayek and conservatism\n\nThe Road was especially popular in the US. This was helped by Reader's Digest publishing a shortened edition in 1945, exposing Hayek to a non-academic audience of some 9 million households. He was seized upon by conservatives opposing Franklin D Roosevelt's interventionist New Deal, who feared for the loss of personal freedoms and a drift to totalitarianism.\n\nHowever, Hayek was concerned his ideas had been oversimplified and misinterpreted. He warned of ""the very dangerous tendency of using the term 'socialism' for almost any kind of state which you think is silly or you do not like"". By the mid-1950s he had distanced himself from American and European conservatives.\n\nUltimately, though, after the second world war most western countries adopted a more Keynesian approach. Named for Kayek's greatest intellectual rival, John Maynard Keynes, this involved government spending to influence things like employment and economic growth.\n\nHayek's work, meanwhile, was mostly ignored until the 1970s, a period during which the UK became mired in stagflation and industrial action. He then became the inspiration for Margaret Thatcher's policy mix of deregulation, privatisation, lower taxes and a bonfire on state controls of the economy. With the US also facing domestic economic challenges, the then US president, Ronald Reagan, followed suit.\n\nWhat the critics say\n\nIf that was perhaps peak Hayek, he has been heavily criticised in recent years. The American economist John Komlos, in his 2016 paper, Another Road to Serfdom, convincingly argues:\n\nHayek failed to see that any concentration of power is a threat to freedom. The free market that he advocated enabled the concentration of power in the hands of a powerful elite.\n\nSuch over-concentration had created the ""too big to fail"" environment in the financial sector in the run-up the global financial crisis of 2008, and many thought Hayekian deregulation was the culprit.\n\nMore recently, the tax-cutting economic policies during Liz Truss's short stint as UK prime minister were incubated by think tanks who regard themselves as the keepers of the Hayekian flame. Similarly, Argentinian president Javier Milei's libertarian vision of a minimalist state is said to be influenced by Hayek.\n\nEqually, however, it is easy to fall into that trap of oversimplifying Hayek. It is worth noting, for instance, that in the Road, he also envisaged a substantial role for the state. He saw the state providing a basic minimum income for all. He also argued that ""an extensive system of social services is fully compatible with the preservation of competition"".\n\nEven Keynes congratulated him on his publication, saying, ""morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it"".\n\nIn short, while it's probably fair to say that the world has had to suffer the flaws in Hayek's ideas, it is important to separate him from his supporters. He was certainly no statist, but his vision for how best to run an economy was not as uncompromising as many would have us believe.\n\nConor O'Kane does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,author,FALSE,null,null,0.3411764705882352,447877323,1

Today he promised to give away his own ""truth-seeking"" chatbot Grok for free.\n\nAfter suing OpenAI this month, alleging the company has become too closed, Elon Musk says he will release his ""truth-seeking"" answer to ChatGPT, the chatbot Grok, for anyone to download and use.\n\n""This week, @xAI will open source Grok,"" Musk wrote on his social media platform X today. That suggests his AI company, xAI, will release the full code of Grok and allow anyone to use or alter it. By contrast, OpenAI makes a version of ChatGPT and the language model behind it available to use for free but keeps its code private.\n\nMusk had previously said little about the business model for Grok or xAI, and the chatbot was made available only to Premium subscribers to X. Having accused his OpenAI cofounders of reneging on a promise to give away the company's artificial intelligence earlier this month, Musk may have felt he had to open source his own chatbot to show that he is committed to that vision.\n\nOpenAI responded to Musk's lawsuit last week by releasing email messages between Musk and others in which he appeared to back the idea of making the company's technology more closed as it became more powerful. Musk ultimately plowed more than $40 million into OpenAI before parting ways with the project in 2018.\n\nWhen Musk first announced Grok was in development, he promised that it would be less politically biased than ChatGPT or other AI models, which he and others with right-leaning views have criticized for being too liberal. Tests by WIRED and others quickly showed that although Grok can adopt a provocative style, it is not hugely biased one way or another -- perhaps revealing the challenge of aligning AI models consistently with a particular viewpoint.\n\nOpen sourcing Grok could help Musk drum up interest in his company's AI. Limiting Grok access to only paid subscribers of X, one of the smaller global social platforms, means that it does not yet have the traction of OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini. Releasing Grok could draw developers to use and build upon the model, and may ultimately help it reach more end users. That could provide xAI with data it can use to improve its technology.\n\nMusk's move to liberate Grok sees him align with Meta's approach to generative AI. Meta's open source models, like Llama 2, have become popular among developers because they can be fully customized and adapted to different uses. But adopting a similar strategy could draw Musk further into a growing debate over the benefits and risks of giving anyone access to the most powerful AI models.\n\nMany AI experts argue that open sourcing AI models has significant benefits such as increasing transparency and broadening access.

I've had some quite long conversations with Rishi about AI and it's not just that he understands it, we were talking about different algorithms.

The truck could withstand shots from a handgun, but couldn't fend off faster weapons. Musk has hyped up the Cybertruck's rugged nature since its debut in 2019.\n\nThe Cybertruck might not be as bulletproof as Elon Musk has advertised.\n\nZach Nelson, known for his YouTube channel JerryRigEverything, put the vehicle to the test. In a video that was uploaded on Friday, Nelson shot the electric pickup truck with a series of guns, including an AR-15 and .50-caliber rifle.\n\n""Nothing is actually bulletproof. There's always going to be a bigger bullet, but today we are going to see scientifically where that line gets drawn,"" Nelson said in the video.\n\nThe Cybertruck was able to survive shots from a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber rifle which left small dents in the metal. However, Nelson noted the truck's metal cracked if the shots landed too close together on the metal.\n\nThe truck took on more damage, however, when Nelson brought in some faster weapons, including a .17-caliber rifle, as well as an AR-15 and .50-caliber gun. The video from the .50-caliber gun shows the shot flying through the car door -- which Nelson left open to avoid damaging the truck's interior -- and taking a nickel-sized chunk out of the metal. The metal also cracked all the way through when Nelson fired the .223-caliber AR-15 at the vehicle.\n\nWhile the truck didn't prove entirely bulletproof, Nelson said he was still impressed by its durability.\n\n""The truck is still in one piece,"" Nelson said in the video. ""There's a few ventilation holes now, but, overall, I am very satisfied with how bullet -resistant the Cybertruck is. It works on 9 millimeter, .22. Anything faster than that and there's gonna be a hole, but still slowing down a bullet is infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle.""\n\nNotably, a .50-caliber rifle is an incredibly high-powered weapon. A single round from a .50-caliber Browning Machine Gun could ""knock down hovering helicopters, penetrate armored limousines,"" according to The Small Arms Review.\n\nAn auto expert previously told InsideEVs, that the Cybertruck will likely be able to deflect weapons that have a lower velocity like a pistol or a Tommy Gun, but it won't be able to withstand faster weapons, like a .223 AR-15. -- which can fire bullets at a speed of around 3,000 feet per second, more than three times as fast as a Tommy Gun. (During the vehicle's delivery event in November, Tesla also shared a video of the truck surviving a round of bullets from a .45-caliber Tommy Gun.)\n\nNelson and a spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the Cybertruck was first announced in 2019, Musk has hyped up the rugged nature of the truck, claiming the vehicle would be entirely bulletproof.\n\nWhen Musk first revealed the Cybertruck in 2019 he attempted to demonstrate the vehicle's ""armor glass"" windows by having Tesla's design boss throw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window. At the time, the glass immediately broke on contact with the metal ball. Musk later said on social media that a prior test had compromised the window.\n\n""Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door.""\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan in 2023, Musk said that the standard Cybertruck wouldn't have bulletproof glass, but the stainless steel doors would still be thick enough to stop a bullet. Musk said Tesla would also offer a version of the truck with thicker fixed-pane glass windows.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",businessinsider.nl,news,Business Insider Nederland,grace_kay@businessinsider.nl,Grace Kay,author,FALSE,https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/65ef2a70ce7f1785b2e875e2.jpg?ver=1710180130,eng-9385104,-0.058823529,447876646,4

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump told the hosts. ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media."" ""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,'' he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections."" Trump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organisations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the US, most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a US ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: ""I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.'' ""But,'' he went on to say, ""you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.'' Some American companies, he charged, are ""not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.'' Biden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls ""countries of concern,"" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The US government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,'' he wrote. ''They are a true Enemy of the People!'' Trump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly'' but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.'' Trump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,'' which Trump has railed against.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",devdiscourse.com,news,Devdiscourse,,,,,https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_40_2945094.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg,eng-9380150,-0.011764706,447876586,1

Trump posted the message, which also mentioned ""No Energy Independence"" and the ""Green New Scam,"" as he lashed out against the criminal charges he faces.\n\nTrump met with Musk in Palm Beach, Florida, last week, as he looks to boost donations to his presidential campaign. Musk later said that he would not donate money to ""either candidate for US president"" -- though some are unconvinced.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Musk served on two presidential advisory councils but left after Trump elected to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that Trump's links to the oil and gas industry limited his support of EV manufacturers like Tesla during his presidency. Musk also claimed he voted for Biden, not Trump, in 2020 -- though, according to his biographer, he actually stayed home on Election Day. In May 2022, Musk said he planned on voting Republican in ""this election,"" but didn't specify if he meant the midterms or the 2024 presidential election. Later that year, he said he was undecided on whether he'd vote for Trump.\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from criticizing Musk in recent years. In 2022, Trump said the tech billionaire had come to the White House asking for help ""on all of his many subsidized projects,"" including his ""electric cars that don't drive long enough,"" his ""driverless cars that crash,"" and his ""rocketships to nowhere.""\n\n""I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,"" the former president said at the time.\n\nTrump on Monday acknowledged the United Auto Workers recently endorsed President Biden's campaign -- adding that union leaders were ""like blind sheep."" Nevertheless, he asserted that ""the autoworkers are going to vote for Trump.""\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",businessinsider.nl,news,Business Insider Nederland,camilo_fonseca@businessinsider.nl,Camilo Fonseca,author,FALSE,https://i.insider.com/656ef3e90ec98e92f74c0a2a?format=jpeg,eng-9384448,0.074509804,447876583,4

America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin.

Titles such as Paved With Good Intentions, The Bell Curve, Alien Nation, Why Race Matters, Race, Evolution and Behavior, and Hating Whitey are some of the books that challenged racial orthodoxy yet were still published, reviewed, and often sold in major bookstores during the 1990s. Of course, the thaw eventually ended, and by the end of the decade, the publishing industry again began silencing dissidents. By 2011, Jared Taylor, unable to find a publisher for his book White Identity, concluded: ""[T]his book is unfit for commercial publication in the United States."" Eventually self-published, it was banned from Amazon.\n\nBut a spate of books released in the last 12 months -- mostly by mainstream sources -- suggests a pushback against anti-white policies and attitudes that plague every Western institution. Some of these works have made the bestseller lists and have been promoted on a growing web of dissident podcasts, publications, and social media accounts. None call outright for white advocacy, but they all acknowledge that anti-whiteness is a major factor in American life. Most of these books have been reviewed in American Renaissance and are summarized below.\n\nPushing back\n\nAmerica's Cultural Revolution by Chris Rufo argues that left-wing activists waged a successful war on America and now control all of its institutions. The result is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Critical Race Theory (CRT), and other anti-white propaganda being pushed on everyone, including school children. Mr. Rufo urges a ""counter revolution"" against leftist domination, and he has become a leading activist in that movement, even exposing the plagiarism of Harvard's anti-white president, Claudine Gay. America's Cultural Revolution was published by Broadside Books, an imprint of Harper Collins, and it became a number-one Amazon bestseller upon its release in July 2023.\n\nWhen Race Trumps Merit by Heather Mac Donald was released by DW Books, a new publishing arm of the conservative Daily Wire media empire. Miss Mac Donald discusses the racial madness that has been inflicted upon the United States since the May 2020 George Floyd riots. Her book focuses mostly on how BLM-style propaganda infests medicine, science, the fine arts, law, and justice. She contends that whites are debasing themselves before blacks to the point of staying silent about anti-white policies and black incompetence, even if they know these hurt their company, organization, or nation. The author advocates telling the truth about race. She also suggests forming a membership organization dedicated to an ""unapologetic defense of color-blind standards of achievement and behavior [that] would relentlessly provide the data that explain the lack of racial proportionality in meritocratic institutions and the criminal justice system.""\n\nThe Origins of Woke: Civil Rights Law, Corporate America, and the Triumph of Identity Politics by Richard Hanania was published by Broadside Books. Mr. Hanania survived a doxing campaign by leftists when it was discovered he had written provocatively about race under the pen name of Richard Hoste a decade previously. His book argues that civil rights law causes our institutions to be woke. Leftists used civil rights laws to come to power and now force their values and beliefs on everyone else. The author sees clearly on race and IQ differences. He advocates working through the system to elect candidates who can then appoint judges who will overturn the worst aspects of civil rights laws.\n\nThe War on Whites by Ed Brodow was self-published in 2023 but reached a wide audience. It was the number-one bestseller on Amazon in the category of General Sociology of Race Relations and reached number five in Cultural Policy. The author documents case after case of anti-white animus from media, universities, corporations, schools and other institutions. He has since become an advocate for white people, though his main goal is to end identity politics for everyone.\n\nUntenable: The True Story of White Ethnic Flight from America's Cities by Jack Cashill was released by Post Hill Press in July 2023. It tells the little-known story of how ethnic whites were pushed out of Northern cities in the 1960s and 1970s by black crime and violence. As noted on the Amazon page for the book, ""[T]he ethnic Americans driven from their homes and neighborhoods -- the author included -- finally get the chance to tell their side of the story."" While anti-white violence is part of the story, another consequence is the loss of a true community felt by these mostly working-class whites when they moved to the suburbs.\n\nNot Stolen: The Truth About European Colonialism in the New World by Jeff Flynn-Paul was published in 2023 by Bombardier Books (a division of Post Hill Press). A professor of Global History and Economics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, the author challenges some of the anti-white myths about the United States and its treatment of American Indians. He notes that the number of Indians killed by whites has been greatly exaggerated, most land was purchased -- not stolen -- by whites, and that no genocide occurred.\n\nWhite advocates might point out that with the partial exception of The War on Whites, none of the books listed above openly advocates for whites, and only Richard Hanania stresses racial differences in intelligence. But many of these authors take aim at civil rights laws and point out how they have led to anti-white discrimination and attitudes. A decade ago, such sentiments would be limited to outlets such as American Renaissance, VDARE, and Counter-Currents. The taboo is slowly being lifted. Moreover, the authors themselves seem to know the score when it comes to race and are not afraid to express forbidden thoughts on social media. Perhaps their next books will be even more explicit about anti-whiteness:\n\nIn addition to the publishers of these books, a number of smaller dissident-right publishers that are open to white advocacy have appeared. If this new ""interglacial"" period ends -- as the 1990s period did -- these outlets should still be able to offer the truth about race:\n\nThis brief period of openness on the part of mainstream publishers might be shut down. Despite selling well and spurring debate, these books challenge and enrage the Left. Nothing would make leftists happier than silencing dissenters as they did on social media before the Elon Musk takeover of Twitter in late 2022. Alternatively, this might be just the beginning. A new wave of books on race -- including ones that tell the truth about racial differences and America's demographic disaster -- could well be on the horizon. Those who already know the truth on race should welcome this chance to educate even more people to racial realities.",amren.com,news,American Renaissance,,,,,https://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CulturalRevolution.jpg,null,-0.003921569,447876324,1

One year later, the Model 3 RWD with an LFP battery pack appeared in the US, with the LFP-powered Model Y RWD following in 2023. Now, Tesla offers LFP pack retrofit even for Model 3 EVs that initially shipped with 2170 cells. 6 photosPhoto: Tesla Li-ion batteries power almost all portable devices we use today, from phones and laptops to electric cars and even homes. However, not all Li-ion batteries are created equal, with several chemistries and form factors offering advantages and disadvantages. There's no ideal battery type, so the use-case scenario dictates their characteristics. For electric vehicles, three chemistries have become dominant: lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA), and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC).\n\nLFP cells are cheap to produce and have many advantages in terms of safety and durability, but the iron is heavy, which affects energy density. NCA and NCM cells have high energy density, so they are used in performance EVs but have lower durability and are less stable than LFP. Tesla uses all three types in its EVs, with LFP cells in the base version of the Model 3 and Model Y and nickel-based chemistries in the rest of its lineup. The Model 3 was the first Tesla model to use the LFP cells, first for cars built at Giga Shanghai (since 2020) and later (2021) for those at Fremont.\n\nSince Tesla started sales of the Model 3 in 2017, there have been cars that already required a battery replacement. Thankfully, Tesla offers an eight-year warranty for the battery pack, so these replacements have been performed under warranty. Until now, Tesla replaced defective 2170-cell battery packs with similar packs using NCA cells produced by Panasonic in Sparks, Nevada. However, a new report shows that Tesla is now actively proposing replacing the NCA packs with LFP-based equivalents.\n\nThe information has been shared on Elon Musk's social media network X by Warren (@Warren_pr1). Tesla requires affected Model 3 owners to sign a written agreement before installing the LFP pack. The document mentions both the advantages and disadvantages of having an LFP replacement instead of an NCA battery pack. The agreement is necessary to shield Tesla from possible complaints related to the LFP replacement.\n\nBased on the document shared by Warren, the new LFP pack offers a longer service life, which is expected considering the chemistry. However, Tesla also promised that the new pack offers more range than the original NCA battery. Another advantage is the possibility of charging it to 100% daily instead of limiting the charge to 80%, as recommended for ternary batteries. This yields even more range in everyday driving, releasing the extra 20% capacity for regular use.\n\nIt's not all rosy because the LFP battery pack is heavier than the original battery. This affects the 0-60 acceleration time, which increases by about half a second. This also affects the vehicle's dynamics, which is why Tesla is upgrading the suspension to cope with the increased weight. The upgrade includes new springs, dampers, and a 4-wheel alignment.",autoevolution.com,news,autoevolution,cristian_agatie@autoevolution.com,Cristian Agatie,author,FALSE,https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-offers-lfp-pack-retrofit-for-2170-equipped-model-3-that-need-a-battery-replacement-230641_1.jpeg,null,0.1137254901960785,447876165,1

Brilliant minds are split about the progress of the systems - some say it will improve humanity, and others fear the technology will destroy it\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt says A.I. could endanger humanity in 5 YEARS - as he likens devastation to nuking Nagasaki and Hiroshima\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt (pictured) is pushing for international governments to come together to regulate AI before it gets out of control. Speaking at a summit last November, Schmidt compared the need for regulating AI to weapon regulations after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima during WWII.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn offensive, advanced AI, they write, 'could potentially be used to design and even execute catastrophic biological, chemical, or cyber attacks, or enable unprecedented weaponized applications in swarm robotics.'\n\nBut the report floats a second, even more dystopian scenario, which they describe as a 'loss of control' AI risk.\n\nThere is, they write, 'reason to believe that they [weaponized AI] may be uncontrollable if they are developed using current techniques, and could behave adversarially to human beings by default.'\n\nIn other words, the machines may decide for themselves that humanity (or some subset of humanity) is simply an enemy to be eradicated for good.\n\nGladstone AI's CEO, Jérémie Harris, also presented similarly grave scenarios before hearings held by the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology within Canada's House of Commons last year, on December 5, 2023.\n\n'It's no exaggeration to say the water-cooler conversations in the frontier AI safety community frames near-future AI as a weapon of mass destruction,' Harris told Canadian legislators.\n\n'Publicly and privately, frontier AI labs are telling us to expect AI systems to be capable of carrying out catastrophic malware attacks and supporting bioweapon design, among many other alarming capabilities, in the next few years,' according to IT World Canada's coverage of his remarks.\n\n'Our own research,' he said, 'suggests this is a reasonable assessment.'\n\nHarris and his co-authors noted in their new State Dept. report that the private-sector's heavily venture-funded AI firms face incredible 'incentive to scale' to beat their competition more than any balancing 'incentive to invest in safety or security.'\n\nThe only viable means of pumping the breaks in their scenario, they advise, is outside of cyberspace, via the strict regulation of the high-end computer chips used to train AI systems in the real world.\n\nGladstone AI's report calls the nonproliferation work on this hardware, the 'most important requirement to safeguard long-term global safety and security from AI.'\n\nAnd it was not a suggestion they made lightly, given the inevitable likelihood of industry outcries: 'It's an extremely challenging recommendation to make, and we spent a lot of time looking for ways around suggesting measures like this,' they said.\n\nOne of the Harris' brothers co-authors on the new report, ex-Defense Department official Mark Beall served as the Chief of Strategy and Policy for the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center during his years of government service.\n\nBeall appears to be acting urgently on the threats identified by the new report: the ex-DoD AI strategy chief has since left Gladstone to launch a super PAC devoted to the risks of AI.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Americans for AI Safety, launched on this Monday with the stated hope of 'passing AI safety legislation by the end of 2024.'",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,,,,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/11/16/82326841-0-image-m-3_1710176093710.jpg,eng-9384609,-0.294117647,447876000,1

Now, they merely need to have ""an intent"" to reside in California.\n\nAdditionally, the illegal alien-facing services would be expanded to include ""legal representation and related services for removal defense.""\n\nThe most contentious part of the Democratic bill is its proposed removal of the current prohibition on the ""use of the grant funds to provide legal services to an individual who has been convicted of, or who is currently appealing a conviction for, a violent or serious felony.""\n\nAccordingly, California taxpayers would effectively fund legal efforts to help iIlegal aliens like those who allegedly murdered beloved Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 2-year-old Jeremy Poou-Caceres of Maryland, and Ruperto Mondragon Salgado of Dallas stay in the country and possibly even eliminate their sentences.\n\n""For as long as I have been in state office, I have worked towards ensuring people are given a second chance and have championed efforts to prevent people from being treated as second-class individuals,"" said Jones-Sawyer. ""The REP for All Immigrants Act ensures racial justice and truly equitable access to crucial immigration services for all - not some.""\n\nAssemblyman Bilal Essayli (R) noted on X, ""These are the exact policies that led to the murder of a nursing student in Georgia, Laken Riley.""\n\nResponding to the bill on X, South African billionaire Elon Musk wrote, ""When is enough enough?""\n\nAssemblywoman Kate Sanchez (R) said ""AB 2031 is completely UNACCEPTABLE. Why do they want to prioritize immigrant rapists & murderers over everyone else?""\n\n-- (@)\n\nSanchez noted further that the Assembly Judiciary committee would be holding a hearing on the bill Tuesday and asked her followers to ""call your legislators to let them know your opinion on it.""\n\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra (D) is the chair of the Judiciary Committee. Diane Dixon (R) is its vice chair. The members of the committee are as follows: Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D); Isaac Bryan (D); Damon Connolly (D); Matt Haney (D); Brian Maienschein (D); Tina McKinnor (D); Blanca Pacheco (D); Kate A. Sanchez (R); Eloise Gomez Reyes (D); and Marie Waldron (R).\n\nWhile critics have noted that Jones-Sawyer's bill will help criminal noncitizens at the expense of American citizens, Shayna Kessler, associate director for advocacy with the New York-based Vera Institute of Justice, appeared to figure that to be the point, suggesting that the ""current criminal exclusion exacerbates systemic racism in the criminal legal and immigration systems.""\n\n""California must remain a leader in protecting its immigrant communities and pass the California REP4All Act to advance universal legal representation for all people facing deportation, regardless of their interaction with the criminal legal system,"" added Kessler.\n\nMashih Fouladi, executive director at the California Immigrant Policy Center, intimated that having citizens bankroll the legal defense of convicted murderers and rapists is a matter of helping vulnerable families.\n\n""The California Immigrant Policy Center (CIPC) is proud to support and co-sponsor the REP4All bill that would ensure immigrant families have access to the legal services and resources they need to thrive with safety and stability - regardless of an individual's criminal history,"" said Fouladi. ""Publicly funded immigration services protect the most vulnerable families in our state and improve the quality of life of all Californians.""",conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,,,,https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/when-is-enough-enough-california-bill-would-use-taxpayer-funds-to-protect-violent-illegal-aliens-from-deportation.jpg?id=51705254&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C255,eng-9384865,-0.11372549,447875819,1

The Western media's coverage of this issue often exhibits a double standards - by comparing their reactions to similar global conflicts - and systematic falsification aimed at distorting facts to support the oppressor and occupier, the Israeli entity. This is not to generalise, as there are Western efforts by individuals and political and humanitarian organisations that adhere to journalistic integrity.\n\nThe falsification has reached the point of publishing fake images using artificial intelligence technologies, such as fabricating a video clip of the bombing of the Al Mamdani Hospital in Gaza, which was bombed by the occupying entity. Israel tried to deny this heinous crime and attribute it to the Palestinian resistance. However, the video Israel published was proven to be fake and altered, exposing the falsehood of the Israeli narrative and confirming their commission of the crime and deliberate lying. Similarly, claims of the Palestinian resistance burning an Israeli child and publishing a photo of a charred child's body were later debunked as fake, created using AI technologies and originally a photo of a 'dog'. American political activist Jackson Hinkle was among the first to point out the falsification of this image by comparing it to the original.\n\nHinkle, like others in the West and East who defend the Palestinian cause, has faced and continues to face pressures from government and private institutions supporting the Israeli entity. This resulted in the shutdown of his YouTube channel, which had over 300,000 followers, and actions like The Guardian's dismissal of British cartoonist Steve Bell for drawing a satirical cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, disregarding the values of freedom of speech advocated by the West.\n\nThe role of smart technologies is not limited to falsifying images and videos but extends to introducing ""self-serving"" AI algorithms on various social media platforms like those owned by Meta (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads) and Google's YouTube. These platforms are among the most supportive of the occupying entity through their intelligent algorithms designed to selectively filter content and ban specific accounts based on political or religious orientations, reflecting these platforms' ethical double standards, bias, and lack of freedom of expression. These policies, influenced by the pressures from some Western governments, aim to sway public opinion in favour of the Western stance that supports the existence and victory of the occupying entity, even at the expense of the Palestinian cause and the oppression and killing of its people. This strategy has been relatively successful on most social media platforms mentioned earlier and relatively unsuccessful on others like the X platform (formerly Twitter), where owner Elon Musk has adhered to principles of free speech and neutrality despite pressures from some Western governments.\n\nIn any case, this behaviour by some social media platforms is expected, especially in military conflicts. The West is concerned with its political and economic interests, partly tied to the existence and dominance of the Israeli entity, among other historical reasons. These platforms, owned by Western companies, have no choice but to follow the policies of their governments and owners. The policies of supporting the occupying entity are not limited to this aspect; channels like Al Aqsa TV, which supports the Palestinian cause and reports on its events, have been shut down by stopping their broadcast via the Eutelsat satellite following pressures from the French government.\n\nThe impact of smart technologies on the course of these events and their influence on public engagement is evident. However, we have not lost the counter-efforts that strive to convey the true picture and expose all forms of falsification. It's crucial that such digitally influenced events guide our directions in digital and technological investments and redefine our understanding of the importance of these technologies. Nations committed to human justice should allocate a special place for developing independent smart technologies like social media platforms, satellites, cloud computing, and AI systems. Achieving this requires a comprehensive and serious development of education at all levels, attention to and generous support for scientific research, encouragement for establishing digital and technological companies, and supporting them.",omanobserver.om,news,Oman Observer,,,,,https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/03/11/thumbs/600x600/2605345.jpg,null,-0.098039216,447875694,1

""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations - which were fully permitted under campaign finance law - went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nFILE - The TikTok Inc. building is seen in Culver City, Calif., on March 17, 2023.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger - a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China´s ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People´s Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: ""I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\n""But,"" he went on to say, ""you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.""

She went viral for dunking on Barron who no longer has an X account after being banned pre-Elon Musk. When Barron got wind of the smear, she destroyed Khan in a very gracious manner that was pretty much unassailable, ending her attacker's short-lived fame.\n\n""This accent needs to be illegal and women should be banned from doing manual labour like this. There is NOTHING feminine about American women. American women are literally men,"" Khan viciously wrote on X.\n\nCPA Andrea Katherine posted Barron's response, leading off with her own comment, ""UPDATE: Hannah Barron has responded. Beautiful, gracious young lady.""\n\nBarron made it abundantly clear that one can be very feminine and a hard worker, adding that there is nothing un-feminine about building houses, doing hard work, hunting, or fishing. Women have done those things throughout history. And her accent is simply charming.\n\n""Good morning, y'all. I don't have a Twitter. I did at one point but my account got removed for whatever reason and I just hadn't got around to making another account,"" Barron began in her video response.\n\n""But apparently I'm trending on Twitter right now because some girl said my accent should be illegal, women shouldn't do manual labor... and what else did she say? American women are basically men and she just said I was not feminine. Oooh! And I would tell y'all this girl's name but I can't remember it because I don't have a clue who she is. So, that should tell you how relevant this person is,"" she added.\n\nShe addressed the viral attack and explained how it didn't phase her.\n\n""But I just think it's hilarious because I grew up as the weird kid in high school who hunted and fished too much because back then it wasn't cool for women to hunt and fish or the whole country lifestyle. And I'm so proud of all the women in the outdoors now who are making that more cool or popular. So proud of them. Think we're doing great,"" Barron contended.\n\n""But, I've been helping Dad build houses since I was 15. When I was a senior in high school I taught kids how to weld in AG class, so I've done... not manual labor... when I think of manual labor I think of what my Dad does. I'm nowhere near that. I just help as much as I can and I try. And it's fun. And there's nothing wrong with that,"" she asserted.\n\nIn the end, Barron advised others to just be themselves and ignore the noise from those like the Lebanese reporter who attacked her from out of the blue.\n\n""There's a lot of blue-collar women out there who are also feminine. And so I just think that you should embrace your own individuality. Be yourself and don't worry about what anybody else said, because these folks talking about me think they're gonna offend me... that ship sailed a long time ago. I've been getting picked on my whole life. I grew up around men. Oh well,"" Barron mused.\n\n""So, don't be scared to build your own box, and don't try to fit in anybody else's. Be your own person and you'll be happier in the long run because of that. And don't worry about what anybody else has to say. Hope y'all have a good one. Appreciate y'all,"" she concluded.\n\nBarron received a lot of support on X, going viral herself for not letting the elitist woman get to her:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.
