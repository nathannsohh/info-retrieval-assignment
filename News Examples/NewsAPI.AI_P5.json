New technologies are supercharging online disinformation, which as we know, quickly turns into real-life conflict. At the same time, laws and regulations around speech and online content are stuck in the past century. On this week's Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Barbara McQuade, former federal prosecutor and author of Attack From Within: How Disinformation Is Sabotaging America, to discuss whether and how the courts might handle a dizzying array of new threats to election integrity from social media and disinformation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: The United States is uniquely susceptible [to disinformation] in part because of the First Amendment, in part because of a legal regime under which we operate, and this notion that for better or for worse, the marketplace of ideas is the way to go. You talk about how corrupt and corruptible the marketplace of ideas is. But I find myself struck by the twin facts that we have archaic doctrine that cannot possibly metabolize technological change fast enough, and then we also have these archaic ideas about how a marketplace of ideas could work. Do you mind just thinking through the ways in which it's almost overdetermined that we can't get control of this because of the constraints of the First Amendment?\n\nBarbara McQuade: I think we can, but I do think that it makes it really challenging. We all cherish the First Amendment; people on the left, on the right, and in between. Everybody understands why the First Amendment is so important. And so it makes it difficult to say \"We're going to ban disinformation,\" because who is the arbiter of what is disinformation and what is not? But we need to rethink social media and whether it's completely hands-off. As you well know, no right is absolute, including our First Amendment rights to free speech. As long as there is satisfaction of strict scrutiny -- that is, a compelling governmental interest and a limitation that is narrowly tailored to achieve -- that interest does pass constitutional muster.\n\nSo I think we need to think about that online. People refer to social media as the virtual town square. Elon Musk loves to say that this is the modern town square. But it's really different from the town square, right? It's very different from a real person standing on a soap box in the town square. In the town square, we can see who's speaking. Is it really a Black activist or is it a Russian guy in a hoodie? We can assess their credibility based on who it is. We can also see how other members of the public are responding. Are people cheering? Are they booing? Are they just walking by and ignoring this person?\n\nWhereas online, people get likes and shares that may be generated by bots. It might be controlled by the speaker themselves, but we don't know that. So they can create the illusion of popularity when it may be that no real people are liking and sharing that message at all. So the parallels don't work the way they do in real life. But I do think that we can regulate social media even without addressing content, and that might be the way to do it. Content-based regulation is where you get into trouble with the First Amendment.\n\nBut there are other things we could do -- like regulating the algorithms, the computer code that tells programs what to do. A couple of years ago, there was this Facebook whistleblower named Frances Haugen. She was a data scientist at Facebook and she disclosed that Facebook was designing algorithms to deliberately generate outrage. Because if you were outraged, you were more likely to stay online. More eyeballs would be on the ads, and the platform would make more money. So people were being manipulated so that Facebook could turn a profit. You know the old phrase, \"If you don't know what the product is, it's probably you\"? Turns out it was true at Facebook. So we could have regulations that say that algorithms may not be used to manipulate people to generate outrage, or at least require disclosure of those algorithms, so that people would know which platforms are trying to use them to generate outrage.\n\nThe other thing that these social media companies do is they microtarget people to the most minute degree such that they know what messages are going to resonate with you. So I've been shopping for winter boots and suddenly I see ads for winter boots everywhere. Wow. How did they know? Well, they know because of my search history and because of the things I'm clicking on and what I'm communicating with, but they know, down to every detail, everything there is to know about us. And so we get bombarded with certain messages that only we see and maybe other people aren't seeing. And when you and I are not seeing messages other people are seeing, it's very difficult for us to rebut them. Only people in certain echo chambers are hearing certain messages about \"2000 mules,\" or whatever the allegation of the day is, and it's difficult for the rest of society to rebut that the way we could if it were out there in the public domain.\n\nAnd so perhaps disclosing some of the ways groups are being microtargeted, which microgroup we are in, how we're being sorted, we could require disclosure of all of those things.\n\nI want to ask you, because you're so steeped in these questions of data privacy and national security and technology, what you made of oral arguments in these content moderation cases. I'm trying to be generous when I say that you have a Supreme Court who's just in this complete mashup of technology they don't fully understand. They're searching for a metaphor: Is it a publisher or is it a phone company? [What should they do with] Section 230? There's so many pieces of this, and all due respect to the court, they never cover themselves in glory when they do these technology cases.\n\nI think it was Justice Kagan herself who said last term, talking about some of these cases, that the last people you want deciding these issues is nine people in black robes, because we don't get it, we don't understand any of this. It is a challenge as technology becomes more complicated. I know I've talked to a judge who served on the FISA court, where the technology that they're dealing with now for surveillance techniques has become so complicated that they need technical amici to help explain how the systems work.\n\nYou're talking about the two Netchoice cases, Netchoice v. Paxton and Moody v. Netchoice, that are challenging these laws passed in Texas and Florida that would say it is illegal for social media platforms to remove content that violates their community standards. It's really interesting because each side is sort of accusing the other of violating their free speech rights. The states say that the social media platforms are engaging in censorship when they take content down, and the social media platforms are saying, \"You are violating our First Amendment rights by forcing us to say things that violate our terms of service. We don't want bullying and harassment and threats on our platforms because our business model is all about having a safe space for conversation. And you know, sometimes people are a little bit provocative, but we wanna take down anything that might be hurtful or dangerous.\" And so it's this First Amendment faceoff. \"No, you're violating my First Amendment rights.\" \"No, you're violating my First Amendment rights!\"\n\nThere were two justices -- no surprise, I suppose -- Thomas and Alito, who actually did say: How is what you're doing anything but censorship? So, they seem to have their minds made up [as to] who was violating the First Amendment.\n\nBut it seems to me social media platforms are private actors. I don't see how they can possibly violate anyone's First Amendment rights and engage in censorship that would violate the First Amendment, because they're not state actors. They're private entities, so I think they get to decide what goes on their platforms and what doesn't. So I think they're going to win these cases.\n\nIt does raise a bigger issue, though, of how to think about social media platforms. On the one hand, they want to say, \"We're publishers and we should enjoy the same editorial discretion that the New York Times enjoys.\" On the other hand, they say, \"But we're not publishers when it comes to defamation laws, because there we get this immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. We're just a platform! We're like the soap box in the town square, we're not involved in content in any way, we just provide this place where people can come and talk.\" So it kind of seems they want to have it both ways.\n\nAt some point we have to adjust the way we think about social media platforms. They don't really fit squarely into any category, so I think we need to think carefully. We're probably overdue for some adjustments to Section 230. I don't know exactly what that might look like, but it does feel like a little bit of a square peg in a round hole the way we're trying to deal with it right now.\n\nAnd then we've got this other case coming down the pike in the Murthy case -- about whether the Biden administration violated the First Amendment when it asked social media companies to consider removing certain content that was dangerous to public safety, about COVID remedies and other kinds of things.\n\nI suspect that their ability to jawbone with social media companies should remain permissible. But that is a concern too. How heavy-handed can they be in telling social media companies what they can and cannot post? I think as long as it's a request and not a demand, it should be OK. But we're really struggling with figuring out how we deal with this huge part of our lives that doesn't really fit any of our traditional ideas of how speech works.", "source":{"uri":"slate.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Slate Magazine"}, "authors":[{"uri":"dahlia_lithwick@slate.com", "name":"Dahlia Lithwick", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/compote.slate.com\/images\/bfd37dd4-21db-4ebf-9349-39cb3344acfb.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "eventUri":"eng-9383726", "sentiment":0.01960784313725483, "wgt":447884099, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023608683", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"20:12:30", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T20:12:30Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T20:11:48Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.sunjournal.com\/2024\/03\/11\/shrooms-are-a-risky-new-tool-touted-by-some-executive-coaches\/", "title":"'Shrooms are a risky new tool touted by some executive coaches", "body":"Helping businesspeople try to optimize their performance by using hallucinogenic drugs is an eccentric and growing offshoot of the unregulated $5 billion field of executive and life coaching.\n\n\"Adderall, caffeine and stimulants helped with getting things done, but with the advent of AI, productivity is becoming less valuable. Psychedelics can help with the kind of divergent, creative thinking that's more required now,\" says Paul Austin, a lanky, bearded 33-year-old \"microdosing coach\" and founder of Third Wave, which offers courses costing as much as $14,000 to certify psychedelic guides.\n\nThere are new concerns about the credibility of scientific research on psychedelics, and about the effects of daytime dosing in the workplace. Still, drugs like psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, and MDMA, or ecstasy, are stirring widespread optimism in some quarters. They're believed to open people up to new ideas or change, a big draw for coaches.\n\nSome coaches work openly at resorts in countries like Jamaica that haven't outlawed the drugs, while others operate quietly out of private homes or Airbnbs in the U.S., where such drugs are federally illegal but authorities largely look the other way. They cater to a rise in popular interest, and often the particular yearnings of ambitious hedge fund principals, entrepreneurs or executives.\n\n\"I believe psilocybin helps me be a better me, and therefore helps me be a better leader,\" says Jim MacPhee, a 66-year-old leadership consultant who retired as chief operating officer of Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World in 2021. He doesn't encourage his clients to use drugs, or endorse illegal or recreational use, but says his own two experiences during retirement at an overseas retreat have helped him be more \"dialed in\" to his consulting work.\n\nThe reported drug use of Elon Musk, Sergey Brin and the murdered Cash App executive Bob Lee has brought fresh attention to how the business world is affected by rising use of psychedelics. Common concerns like hyper-suggestibility and changes to the brain's executive function are amplified when it comes to those in positions of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They make you more vulnerable and suggestible to others,\" says Sandra Dreisbach, a co-founder of Ethical Psychedelic International Community, which encourages integrity among people who work with the drugs. \"Meanwhile, you're more prone to making large significant changes. People can be inclined to quit their job, leave their significant other, or make huge shifts of lifestyle.\" She advises anyone to wait a week, or even months, after a psychedelic experience before making major decisions.\n\nEven in traditional financial circles, coaches are finding eager clients. At a \"ketitation\" circle that combined ketamine and meditation in New York last fall, a 56-year-old co-founder of a hedge fund who would only give his name as Joseph sat on the floor of a softly lit loft and listened to session leader Zappy Zapolin. Zapolin touted his past roles at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns before he became a psychedelic \"concierge\" to celebrities, and then the business world.\n\n\"This is all about peak performance,\" Zapolin told Joseph and a couple dozen other people, before a light session of Qi Gong movement exercises, acupuncture and ketamine lozenges - plus a spit cup for the heavy salivation they induce.\n\nJoseph said he first tried intravenous-drip ketamine for work stress and depression at a clinic in early 2023, when his fund's performance was weak. \"It helped me to change my mindset and realize that my life isn't tied to my P&L,\" he said, referring to profit-and-loss statements.\n\nRISKS ABOUND\n\nPsychedelic use comes with risks, like lasting perceptual distortions or a sense of detachment from reality, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In California, hospital visits related to hallucinogens rose 54% from 2016 to 2022, according to recent research. Decriminalization hasn't done away with legal risk, either: US seizures of psilocybin soared 247% from 2017 to 2022, a study earlier this year reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin's Third Wave has trained around 200 psychedelic guides since 2021, around a fifth of them executive coaches. At a retreat last fall in the mountains of Colorado, which has decriminalized psychedelic drugs, Austin led \"Psychedelic Trailblazers Mastermind,\" a $3,500-a-head weekend attended by many of Third Wave's students that featured breathwork, intimacy-inducing eye-gazing exercises and lectures - all leading up to a group trip on one of the most powerful strains of psilocybin, Ghost.\n\nOne attendee, Michael, who asked to be identified by his first name only, works in Chicago, where corporate clients pay for his traditional executive coaching sessions. But he's also done underground ceremonies in private homes using MDMA, or ecstasy, and psilocybin. The drugs clear a person's ego out of the way, he said. \"With psychedelics, people are cracked right open.\"\n\nMichael, like five other coaches who work with psychedelics interviewed for this story, declined to go into more detail, citing client confidentiality and their own legal risks. Many said they worked with another person who served the actual drugs.\n\nOne coach, Lauren Mugglebee, told a group at Mastermind that she uses vape-pen-type devices with graduated doses of inhalable \"jaguar,\" a synthetic version of the toad-venom derivative 5-MeO-DMT. Known as the \"business trip\" for its short duration, the drug is also called the \"God molecule\" for its powerful effects. It's ripe for abuse, she said, but effective: \"I'm a coach, not a therapist. I'm looking for things to act as a catalyst.\"\n\nOMAN, BAHRAIN\n\nRonen Aires, a member of Entrepreneurs' Organization, a group for entrepreneurs who own companies generating at least $1 million in annual revenue, said he's given recent talks on psychedelics to EO groups in Oman and Bahrain. Another EO member and executive coach who helps clients with psychedelics, Mark Worster, said he's spoken on psychedelic use with 18 EO chapters in India, four in the US and one in Nepal. By the time he's finished a tour of India this spring, he estimates he will have reached around 1,000 EO members. An EO spokeswoman said the organization doesn't have a position, official or otherwise, on members' potential use of psychedelics in business.\n\nThe mix of drugs and Type-A personalities can create its own pitfalls, with entrepreneurs potentially going overboard and wanting to roll their own psychedelic experience out at scale. Adding executive coaches to the mix makes it even more potent.\n\n\"Coaches are all about 'find your passion and your cosmic why,'\" said Jules Evans, who runs the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project, a nonprofit that studies difficult experiences on the drugs. \"That, combined with these strong imperatives where people seem to get messages from the drug itself, can lead people down blind alleys,\" he said. \"They can be told to build arks, or invest all their money in psychedelics or crypto.\"\n\nInvalid username\/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Over a third of Druckenmiller's total portfolio is invested in just three large-cap stocks.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT is one of the most promising tech giants, as the company's strategic investments in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming are paying off. The company has a sizable stake in the viral generative AI platform ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which generated $1.6 billion in annual revenues in 2023, less than a year since its launch. OpenAI is poised to generate $2 billion in annualized revenues.\n\nShares of MSFT have surged by over 10% so far this year, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's 7.9% gains over this period. Druckenmiller holds approximately 1.1 million of MSFT stock (as of December 31), accounting for roughly 13.1% of his total portfolio.\n\nThe company also invested 15 million euros in French startup Mistral AI, which is widely regarded as a major competitor to OpenAI. While the investment is currently under scrutiny from the European Union because of potential antitrust practices, the stake in Mistral AI could pivot Microsoft to become the biggest player in the generative AI space.\n\nStart generating passive income through real estate\n\nCheck out these featured investments from Benzinga's Real Estate Offerings Screener.\n\nAustin CityfundNadaMin.

U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020.\n\nSrinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and \"simply feed yourself at the trough,\" or:\n\n\"Starve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can't easily seize or print.\"\n\n\"The last is radical but actually realistic,\" he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.\n\n\"Debt increasing by $1 trillion every 90 days. America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin. Please take care.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Srinivasan also warned that as financial reckoning approaches, the \"ravenous state\" may consider confiscating private assets.\n\nSrinivasan offered a handful of examples, such as the seizing of assets from protesting Canadian truckers, freezing Russian assets and the \"weaponization of Delaware against Elon [Musk] and New York against [Donald] Trump.\"\n\n\"Private property will not be protected by the state in a bankrupt Blue America,\" he said before adding:\n\n\"Fortunately, we have Bitcoin, which isn't dependent on the state and can't easily be seized.\"\n\nFinaly, one headline that raised an eyebrow was that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has overtaken MicroStrategy's holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data compiled by BitMEX Research, BlackRock's IBIT holds 197,943 BTC, worth over $13.5 billion as of March 8, nearly 40 trading sessions after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine new funds on Jan. 10.\n\n\"I'm going to be buying the top forever.

Still, drugs like psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, and MDMA, or ecstasy, are stirring widespread optimism in some quarters. They're believed to open people up to new ideas or change, a big draw for coaches.\n\nSome coaches work openly at resorts in countries like Jamaica that haven't outlawed the drugs, while others operate quietly out of private homes or Airbnbs in the U.S., where such drugs are federally illegal but authorities largely look the other way. They cater to a rise in popular interest, and often the particular yearnings of ambitious hedge fund principals, entrepreneurs or executives.\n\n\"I believe psilocybin helps me be a better me, and therefore helps me be a better leader,\" says Jim MacPhee, a 66-year-old leadership consultant who retired as chief operating officer of Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World in 2021. He doesn't encourage his clients to use drugs, or endorse illegal or recreational use, but says his own two experiences during retirement at an overseas retreat have helped him be more \"dialed in\" to his consulting work.\n\nThe reported drug use of Elon Musk, Sergey Brin and the murdered Cash App executive Bob Lee has brought fresh attention to how the business world is affected by rising use of psychedelics. Common concerns like hyper-suggestibility and changes to the brain's executive function are amplified when it comes to those in positions of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They make you more vulnerable and suggestible to others,\" says Sandra Dreisbach, a co-founder of Ethical Psychedelic International Community, which encourages integrity among people who work with the drugs. \"Meanwhile, you're more prone to making large significant changes. People can be inclined to quit their job, leave their significant other, or make huge shifts of lifestyle.\" She advises anyone to wait a week, or even months, after a psychedelic experience before making major decisions.\n\nEven in traditional financial circles, coaches are finding eager clients. At a \"ketitation\" circle that combined ketamine and meditation in New York last fall, a 56-year-old co-founder of a hedge fund who would only give his name as Joseph sat on the floor of a softly lit loft and listened to session leader Zappy Zapolin. Zapolin touted his past roles at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns before he became a psychedelic \"concierge\" to celebrities, and then the business world.\n\n\"This is all about peak performance,\" Zapolin told Joseph and a couple dozen other people, before a light session of Qi Gong movement exercises, acupuncture and ketamine lozenges - plus a spit cup for the heavy salivation they induce.\n\nJoseph said he first tried intravenous-drip ketamine for work stress and depression at a clinic in early 2023, when his fund's performance was weak. \"It helped me to change my mindset and realize that my life isn't tied to my P&L,\" he said, referring to profit-and-loss statements.\n\nRISKS ABOUND\n\nPsychedelic use comes with risks, like lasting perceptual distortions or a sense of detachment from reality, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In California, hospital visits related to hallucinogens rose 54% from 2016 to 2022, according to recent research. Decriminalization hasn't done away with legal risk, either: US seizures of psilocybin soared 247% from 2017 to 2022, a study earlier this year reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin's Third Wave has trained around 200 psychedelic guides since 2021, around a fifth of them executive coaches. At a retreat last fall in the mountains of Colorado, which has decriminalized psychedelic drugs, Austin led \"Psychedelic Trailblazers Mastermind,\" a $3,500-a-head weekend attended by many of Third Wave's students that featured breathwork, intimacy-inducing eye-gazing exercises and lectures - all leading up to a group trip on one of the most powerful strains of psilocybin, Ghost.\n\nOne attendee, Michael, who asked to be identified by his first name only, works in Chicago, where corporate clients pay for his traditional executive coaching sessions. But he's also done underground ceremonies in private homes using MDMA, or ecstasy, and psilocybin. The drugs clear a person's ego out of the way, he said. \"With psychedelics, people are cracked right open.\"\n\nMichael, like five other coaches who work with psychedelics interviewed for this story, declined to go into more detail, citing client confidentiality and their own legal risks. Many said they worked with another person who served the actual drugs.\n\nOne coach, Lauren Mugglebee, told a group at Mastermind that she uses vape-pen-type devices with graduated doses of inhalable \"jaguar,\" a synthetic version of the toad-venom derivative 5-MeO-DMT. Known as the \"business trip\" for its short duration, the drug is also called the \"God molecule\" for its powerful effects. It's ripe for abuse, she said, but effective: \"I'm a coach, not a therapist. I'm looking for things to act as a catalyst.\"\n\nOMAN, BAHRAIN\n\nRonen Aires, a member of Entrepreneurs' Organization, a group for entrepreneurs who own companies generating at least $1 million in annual revenue, said he's given recent talks on psychedelics to EO groups in Oman and Bahrain. Another EO member and executive coach who helps clients with psychedelics, Mark Worster, said he's spoken on psychedelic use with 18 EO chapters in India, four in the US and one in Nepal. By the time he's finished a tour of India this spring, he estimates he will have reached around 1,000 EO members. An EO spokeswoman said the organization doesn't have a position, official or otherwise, on members' potential use of psychedelics in business.\n\nThe mix of drugs and Type-A personalities can create its own pitfalls, with entrepreneurs potentially going overboard and wanting to roll their own psychedelic experience out at scale. Adding executive coaches to the mix makes it even more potent.\n\n\"Coaches are all about 'find your passion and your cosmic why,'\" said Jules Evans, who runs the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project, a nonprofit that studies difficult experiences on the drugs. \"That, combined with these strong imperatives where people seem to get messages from the drug itself, can lead people down blind alleys,\" he said. \"They can be told to build arks, or invest all their money in psychedelics or crypto.\"\n\nInvalid username\/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Photo: Tasos Katopodis\/Getty Images\n\nAs long as two major civil judgments resist appeal, Donald Trump is poised to lose a lot of money. In January, the former president was ordered to pay $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll in a defamation suit. On February 16, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him to pay $354 million for years of inflating his net worth and other acts of business fraud within the Trump Organization. The former president is still extremely rich in assets, but next year would be the perfect time for him to make some easy money.\n\nThis windfall could come from an unlikely place: Truth Social. In mid-February, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the media company's merger with a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, a somewhat surprising move given the deal's checkered history until 'now.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump would own 78 million shares of the new company, or between 58 and 69 percent of his total shares, with a net worth of nearly $4 billion. But that impressive figure comes with a big caveat: Trump would be unable to sell any shares within six months of the deals closing. By the time he can, their value may have plummeted, especially given the importance of Trump's presidential candidacy to Truth Social's net worth. (On March 22, Digital World will hold a shareholder vote on the merger to determine how to move forward.)\n\nSo far, the SPAC route has failed largely because of an investigation by the SEC into the accuracy of its investor disclosures. In case you forgot, since it peaked around 2021, the process involves a real company combined with a shell company to go public without the scrutiny of an IPO. In this case, the shell company is called Digital World Acquisition Corp. and the real one is Truth Socials' parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group. (Neither responded to requests for comment.) SPACs don't have a high success rate and tend to lose a lot of money for investors. The process has largely gone out of fashion, and new regulations aimed at protecting investors make SPACs even less attractive to companies trying to get rich quick.\n\nThe story of Truth Social followed a similar path to many of Trump's failed companies over the years: media attention and inflation of values in the early days, followed by legal problems, allegations of shady financing and difficulties financial. Truth Social could yet challenge this model. But just like Trump's hopes of staying out of prison, his potential success likely depends on winning the presidency again.\n\nTrump's SPAC deal had been stuck in limbo amid this overall downward trend. In 2022, under investigation by the SEC and unable to rally its shareholders, Digital World Acquisition Corp. missed its first deadline to go public, forcing it to return $1 billion in initial investments. (The SEC ultimately settled with the company for misleading investors, which would result in an $18 million fine if the merger went through.) In 2023, in a separate investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors charged three of Trump's partners with insider trading over the proposed merger. Truth Social's user numbers remain extremely disappointing, and financial statements show that its parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, is losing tens of millions in operating costs for every million it receives in advertising revenue. In an SEC filing in November, the company's accountants wrote that they had serious doubts about staying afloat. And as the September merger deadline approaches, there's no indication they've gotten any closer to SEC approval of their financial disclosure to investors, a necessary step any SPAC must accomplish.\n\nBut hints of a possible turnaround by Truth Social began during the Iowa caucuses in January. After Trump's victory in the first primary, shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp. have surged more than 200%, suggesting that retail investors view the social network as a sort of meme stock or, perhaps, see real value in the company. After a SPAC merger is announced, virtually all of the stock typically moves into the hands of retail investors, says Michael Klausner, a Stanford law professor and SPAC skeptic. This was the case for Digital World Acquisition Corp. These people may think the merger has value, but I wouldn't accept their opinion. I have no reason to believe they know anything.\n\nEven if the merger goes through, any rollback depends on what happens in November. If he were to lose the election, that would be really bad for Truth Social's value, says NYU law professor Michael Ohlrogge, another SPAC skeptic. After all, what value is there in a third-tier social media company chaired by a two-time presidential loser? But if he won, Truth Social's current value could indeed endure. Yes, it would take a divisive politician to win the Electoral College with four criminal cases threatening him, even though stranger things have happened, like Trump winning in the first place.\n\nIn late February, another complication arose when the two men who came up with the idea for Truth Social filed a lawsuit against Trump in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that they were being deprived of the profits that were rightfully theirs from the 'business. Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who both appeared on The Apprentice in 2004, introduced Truth Social to Trump in early 2021. They both reportedly ran the day-to-day operations of the Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the site . Both left amid internal strife in 2022. They filed suit through United Atlantic Ventures, an entity they co-founded.\n\nUnder the original deal negotiated by Litinsky and Moss, Trump was entitled to 90 percent of the company, and Litinsky and Moss to 8.6 percent. (The rest went to a lawyer who negotiated the deal.) Their lawsuit alleges that Trump used what he called 11-hour corporate maneuvers, before the merger, to increase the number of shares authorized in the stock from 120 million to 1 billion and that he plans to give many of these additional shares to himself and\/or his associates and children, ultimately reducing the amount Litinsky and Moss should receive to one percent.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Digital World had raised the possibility of legal action by UAV in its filing with the SEC, noting that the case could have a negative impact on investor confidence and perception. of the market. It could also delay the key shareholder vote on March 22.\n\nBut on March 9, the threat of that lawsuit appeared to dissipate after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement during a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court. According to the New York Times, the deal would preserve the two founders' rights to a significant stake in Truth Social's parent company until a judge hears further arguments on the merits of their lawsuit. The presiding judge, Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III, seemed unwilling to push back the March 22 vote date, saying no one is suggesting I should do anything to interfere with the closing, and later remarking that I'm pretty confident we can work. something comes out.\n\nAs with other Trump properties, it's difficult to parse what Truth Social is actually worth. Two years ago, Trump Media & Technology Group was on paper Trump's most valuable asset, with his shares in the company valued at $730 million; this value was crucial in Trump's return to the Forbes list of the 400 richest people on the planet. But Ohlrogge notes that SPACs often inflate values to offset the high cost of such an IPO. There's a real concern here that Trump's media company is inflating its valuation, he says. Trump's accountant feels this way too. In his filing to the Federal Election Commission last year, Trump valued his holdings in Truth Social at between $5 million and $25 million, a far cry from the $1 billion he could hypothetically make from a merger.\n\nThe fact that Trump can still extract money from his lackluster social network helps answer a common question: Why isn't he going back to X? He was once very fond of the app formerly known as Twitter; anyone who has used Truth Social knows they basically ripped them off. And even though X has a growing number of flaws, its estimated monthly user audience is an order of magnitude larger than Truth Social's 500 million, compared to around 600,000.\n\nThere appear to be small reasons why Trump refuses to return. With X's reputation diminishing, Trump doesn't really need it anymore. The combative missives on Truth Social usually end up in the news. Constitutionally, he's not a guy who likes to crawl back; his party has accustomed him to being the one we crawl towards. It also appears that Trump has not resolved his two-year-old spat with X owner Elon Musk, in which he called Twitter worthless and mocked Musk's reliance on regarding federal support for Tesla and SpaceX. I could have told him to get on his knees and beg, and he would have done it, Trump wrote on Truth Social, describing a conversation in which he claimed Musk had asked for government support for a project.\n\nBut there is also a contractual reason for Trump's loyalty to Truth Social. An SEC filing from January says Trump is required to first post on Truth Social six hours before releasing that content elsewhere, a clause that will remain in effect in perpetuity as long as Truth Social is around. Although Trump is not known for honoring contracts, there is a compelling reason to do so here. Any value remaining in the app would plummet if it returned to X. The dream of getting even richer simply by publishing would end.\n\nSubscribe to the Intelligencer newsletter\n\nDaily news on the politics, business and technology that shapes our world.\n\nVox Media, LLC Terms of Use and Privacy Notice\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and agree to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source":{"uri":"exbulletin.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"ExBulletin"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/pyxis.nymag.com\/v1\/imgs\/ff0\/e2d\/cdb39948bae954244ffffbb060f31da22b-trump-phone.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.3411764705882352, "wgt":447883277, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285598994", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:59:43", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:59:43Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:59:34Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.indiagazette.com\/news\/274153615\/india-refuses-to-tailor-policies-to-suit-tesla", "title":"India refuses to tailor policies to suit Tesla", "body":"High import duties have dissuaded the EV maker from launching production in the country\n\nNew Delhi will not change the rules for Elon Musk's Tesla so it can make its long-awaited foray into the Indian market and will instead formulate its policies to attract several global \"potential investors,\" Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal told news agency PTI in a recent interview.\n\nTesla is asking for tariff concessions to offset the customs duty for cars it imports to the country, according to media reports. At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty. Tesla had asked for the concessions as a pre-condition for setting up its first manufacturing unit in India.\n\n\"Government does not tailor policy for any one individual company or its interests,\" Goyal told PTI when asked about Tesla's request. \"Everybody is free to make their demands.

Later that month, Goyal visited Tesla's facility in Fremont, California and said that the company was \"on its way to double its components imports from India.\"\n\nAt the time, Goyal asserted that New Delhi wanted more investment from Tesla and a higher output of EVs in the country soon. \"[Having more EVs] will save foreign exchange, reduce our trade deficits, help us in our fight against inflation, thereby helping us in reducing interest rates,\" the minister told PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest budget, the Indian government included an initiative to focus on both manufacturing and charging infrastructure \"to fortify and broaden the landscape for electric vehicles\" as part of its strategy to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

Trading at $1.19, the asset has seen a remarkable 17% daily increase, contributing to an impressive 73% surge over the past week. This surge has sparked speculation among enthusiasts and investors about BONE's potential to reach the coveted $2 mark by the end of March.\n\nAiming for the $2 Milestone\n\nWhile BONE has made attempts to breach the $2 threshold previously, many believe that the current bull run could provide the momentum needed to propel the asset toward this target. Projections from CoinCodex suggest that BONE may indeed hit the $2 mark later in March, buoyed by prevailing market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\nCommunity Drive for Binance Listing\n\nDespite its growing popularity, BONE has yet to secure a listing on Binance, a major global cryptocurrency exchange. However, the Shiba Inu community, known as the \"SHIB Army,\" has united to advocate for BONE's listing on the platform. Leading this advocacy is Shiba Inu content specialist Lucie, who has urged community members to vote for BONE's listing via the Binance Futures Next platform. Lucie's call emphasizes unity within the SHIB Army and encourages active participation to support BONE's potential listing.\n\nAlso Read: Did Elon Musk Buy Any Shiba Inu Tokens During the Bull Run?\n\nThe Path to Listing\n\nCurrently, BONE holds a prominent position among the nominated tokens on the Binance Futures Next platform, garnering substantial support from community members. SHIB Army members are urged to contribute their votes to enhance BONE's chances of listing on Binance. However, Binance emphasizes that while community support is influential, it does not guarantee a token's listing. The exchange maintains a rigorous evaluation process to ensure transparency and fairness.\n\nListing Success and Market Presence\n\nDespite ongoing efforts for a Binance listing, BONE has secured listings on other prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, HTX, Gate.io, MEXC, Bitget, and Crypto.Com Exchange. These listings underscore BONE's growing presence in the crypto market and its appeal to investors seeking exposure to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of BONE reaching $2 by the end of March 2024 remains a subject of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. With active community support and continued market momentum, BONE's journey toward this milestone reflects the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape and the collective efforts of enthusiasts to foster innovation and adoption in the ecosystem.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Forecasted To Hit 6 Cents: Here's When\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source":{"uri":"businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType":"news", "title":"Business Telegraph"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/usercontent.one\/wp\/www.businesstelegraph.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Shiba-Inu-Can-BONE-Hit-2-This-March-2024.jpeg", "eventUri":"eng-9380522", "sentiment":0.4666666666666666, "wgt":447883099, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285595922", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:55:55", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:55:55Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:55:43Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.industriesnews.net\/news\/274153352\/musk-comments-on-us-attempt-to-weaken-russia", "title":"Musk comments on US attempt to weaken Russia", "body":"The Tesla CEO replied to tech investor David Sacks, who believes Washington's policies have actually made Moscow stronger\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has agreed with investor David Sacks' view that Washington's attempts to weaken Russia have \"come true in reverse\" and in reality only made it stronger.\n\nSharing his opinion on the Ukraine conflict in an interview posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, Sacks called it \"Biden's big backfire.\"\n\n\"We've made the Russian military stronger, it's larger than it was before, it produces far more weapons, the industrial base is ramped up.

Meanwhile, it's the US that has seen its stockpiles \"depleted and hollowed out,\" he argued.\n\nThe economic sanctions on Russia have become another major miscalculation of Biden's policies, according to Sacks.

This obviously makes no sense.\n\nOn Friday, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) forced a vote on an amendment that would have required the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question in any future census, and then bar all non-citizens from being counted for purposes of congressional district and Electoral College apportionment.\n\nDemocrats, who have openly admitted they WANT the illegal aliens to count towards helping them gain more congressional seats and electoral votes, voted the measure down.\n\nMusk responded to the news, first writing:\n\nMost Americans do not know that the US census currently counts, for purposes of voting power, all people in a district, regardless of citizenship!\n\nSenate Democrats just voted unanimously to defeat an amendment that would have stopped counting illegals for congressional seat apportionment and electoral college (presidential) votes.\n\nSince illegals are mostly in Democrat states, both the House and the Presidential vote are shifted ~5% to the left, which is enough to change the entire balance of power!\n\nThis is a major reason why the Biden administration is ushering in record levels of illegals and doing so few deportations.\n\nAnother X user, The Rabbit Hole, posted a poll, asking if people were aware that illegal aliens are counted in determining how many House seats each state gets. A full 51% said no, they were not aware.\n\nMusk responded to the poll, \"This is the biggest corruption of American democracy in the 21st century.\"\n\nSen. Hagerty said in an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, \"Democrats want these illegal migrants in here to create more electoral power. Since Joe Biden came into office, the estimates are as high as 10 million people that have come in here -- that would be 13 extra congressional districts.\"\n\nMusk replied with a sobering warning: \"More Presidential and House of Representatives electoral votes will be assigned to the new illegals Biden has let in than the population of 40 US states. Let that sink in.\"\n\nAlex Lorusso wrote, \"By counting illegal aliens in the census, it incentivizes Democrats to continue the invasion in order to build up power.\"\n\nMusk replied, \"Exactly. Increasing illegals boosts Dem voting power, causing them to recruit even more!\"\n\n\"If Dems win President, House & Senate (with enough seats to overcome filibuster), they'll grant citizenship to all illegals & America will become a permanent one-party deep socialist state.\"\n\nSunday evening, Musk posted a image of a sign that reads, \"Trying to help people understand what's going on right now is like going back into a burning building to pull someone out. Only to have them keep punching you in the face and demand evidence that the building is on fire. Even after they admit they can see the flames.\n\nMusk has also responded to an old video of Barack Obama speaking in 2009 is recirculating on social media.\n\nIn the video, Obama touts a legal process for people to go to the back of the line and earn their citizenship, and admits, \"We can't have half a million people pouring over the border...\"\n\nMusk wrote, \"Now, 10 times as many people per year are \"pouring over the border\", to use Obama's words. America is 4% of Earth's population. If even 1% of Earth moves here - and there is every incentive to do so - that is 80 million people.\"\n\nMusk blasted Biden for voicing regret that he called the Venezuelan man who killed Georgia university student Laken Riley an \"illegal.\"\n\nBiden later said in an MSNBC interview that he should have said \"undocumented.\"\n\n\"Biden is just a grim puppet. He spoke out of turn and was instructed to bend the knee in ignominy,\" Musk wrote.\n\nA Biden parody account on X joked, \"Stop calling them \"illegals.\" They're \"voters.\"\n\nMusk responded to another post by End Wokeness, who writes, \"California's most insane bill yet?

By isso, Every day Tim Cook starts his days at 3:45 in the morning.\n\nAfter agreeing, she begins her routine with a email verificationalso taking into account the work issues that you will have to face today.\n\nAfterwards, continue with a session of exercises 30 to 45 minutes in your personal academy at 5 hours a day, because, as he stated on several occasions, this combination is ideal to start the day with energy and mental clarity.\n\nAfter drinking coffee, you have lunch quickly, Cook schedules important meetings for the rest of your day.

In a rare example of bipartisanship, that declaration seems to have awakened our leaders to the threat such a powerful, anti-American propaganda tool holds. Now, TikTok executives are worried they're running out of time.\n\nAnd they might be right.\n\nTikTok is one of the world's largest social media apps. It's owned by China's ByteDance, which is really like saying that it does the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party. The results are alarming. China manipulates the news our young people see and turns them against America in an outlandish abuse of press freedom. And the app gathers tons of data on them in the process.\n\nTRUMP SAYS TIKTOK A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT BUT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL 'GO CRAZY' WITHOUT IT\n\nIt is widely considered a Chinese spy app and is banned from government phones, though the Biden administration (D-Hypocrites) still has a campaign account on TikTok. Congress has been holding hearings on what to do about the app and its dangerous algorithm. The hearings could force the owners to sell it or possibly have it shut down. So, TikTok called on its millions of devoted followers to harass their congresspeople.\n\nThe result wasn't a typical pressure campaign. Those happen all the time. This was essentially a foreign government pressuring our government to let it continue its anti-American propaganda. TikTok users were warned to, \"speak up now - before your government strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.\"\n\nThe wording in the TikTok call to action of course left out how the bill is just forcing the sale on the owners. But when has the genocidal Chinese government cared about facts, rights or law? Pretty much never.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, \"individual House offices have since received hundreds of calls from TikTok users, at times fielding upward of 20 a minute, according to eight congressional aides.\"\n\nCongressional offices reported getting many calls from citizens as young as 12 - some even threatening suicide if the app were shut down. Some offices turned over their phones to turn off the onslaught. The BBC summed up the result nicely, \"Desperate TikTok lobbying effort backfires on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe bill passed the committee 50-0. It is scheduled for a full House vote on Tuesday, March 12. President Joe Biden has also indicated his support. \"If they pass it, I'll sign it,\" he said.\n\nKEVIN O'LEARY OFFERS TO BUY TIKTOK AND TURN IT INTO A 'NEW AMERICAN COMPANY' IF PROPOSED BAN ADVANCES\n\nTikTok responded by claiming it has rights. China, for the record, is a Marxist dictatorship that regularly threatens its neighbors with attacks and viciously shuts down even tiny hints of freedom like in Hong Kong.\n\n\"This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it. This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,\" TikTok said in a statement.\n\nWe can hope so.\n\nRecently, TikTok launched a media campaign to push back against congressional efforts. It's called, \"TikTok Sparks Good\" and features some of its top creators defending what they are able to do with the platform. Cody and Erika Archie were some of the prominent users who clocked in with their support. The \"first-generation ranchers from Gatesville, Texas,\" have 1.2 million followers on the app and say that, \"TikTok is helping us protect this way of life for future generations.\"\n\nThey seem like nice folks and I can't blame them for not wanting to lose the platform. But Congress has to look at the bigger picture and the many threats posed by China.\n\nTikTok has more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, which is a terrifying power if misused. It has been blamed for \"pushing children and young people towards harmful mental health content,\" according to Amnesty International. That includes \"multiple recommended videos in a single hour romanticizing, normalizing or encouraging suicide.\"\n\nOthers have tied TikTok to the horrific rise in antisemitism in the West, especially among young people who love the app. Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said TikTok is the reason for giving people a \"warped or not reflective of the history\" view of Israel's war against terrorist Hamas. Even Osama bin Laden's \"Letter to America\" was popular for a time on TikTok.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe version of the app we get here isn't even allowed in China. Their version urges young people to learn and better themselves, not to waste their days becoming \"influencers.\"\n\nOur leaders have been wrestling with the influence China has on American social media for some time. India solved the problem in 2020 by banning TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps. American politicians have been more divided because of our tradition of free press - even though TikTok's ultimate bosses don't believe in the concept.\n\nMany conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, are concerned about the ban. Trump said he doesn't want to aid TikTok competitors like Facebook, which often censor conservatives. \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!\" he posted on Truth Social.\n\nTrump is correct about the dangers of other social media. Facebook, YouTube and pre-Elon Musk Twitter all twisted their policies to target the right. But that doesn't mean a foreign app like TikTok should be allowed to manipulate our politics. On Monday, Trump clarified his comments and explained why he's backed away from his effort to ban China-owned app.\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., voiced concerns that people on both sides of the aisle hold. He accused TikTok of \"targeting American children with Chinese Communist Party propaganda -- during school hours -- and recruiting minors to act as foreign agents for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd that's the way we need to look at this, big time.

This decision comes amidst a lawsuit filed by Musk against rival AI chatbot developer OpenAI. In a recent post on the X social media platform dated March 11th, Musk revealed that Grok would be available as open-source software starting from this week.\n\nElon Musk set to make Grok open-source\n\nThe move to make Grok open source has received largely positive responses from users, with many praising Musk for the decision. This announcement comes in the wake of a lawsuit Musk filed against OpenAI on February 29th, alleging a breach of agreement made when OpenAI was established as a nonprofit organization.\n\nMusk contends that OpenAI's recent partnership with Microsoft contradicts the founding principles of the nonprofit agreement, which aimed to advance open-source artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the betterment of humanity. According to Elon Musk, Microsoft's investment of nearly $3 billion in OpenAI by the end of 2023 further complicates matters, as it suggests a shift away from OpenAI's original mission towards more profit-driven objectives.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Elon Musk calls for OpenAI to return to its initial open-source principles and seeks an injunction to halt the for-profit exploitation of AGI technology. However, following the filing of the lawsuit, OpenAI executives released a joint statement revealing emails from Elon Musk that seemed to support the company's transition into a for-profit entity. This revelation has added layers of complexity to the legal battle between Musk and OpenAI.\n\nSince the initiation of the lawsuit, there have been organizational changes within OpenAI, including the reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman as a member of the board. Altman had been fired and subsequently re-hired in November 2023, with the board admitting that his departure had destabilized the company more than anticipated.\n\nMusk's intention for Grok and the OpenAI lawsuit\n\nMusk's decision to release Grok as open source aligns with his stated goals in the lawsuit to promote open-source AGI for the benefit of humanity. Grok, developed by Musk's company xAI, is an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, but with the added capability to access real-time information via the X social media platform.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT, Grok can tackle more contentious issues that other AI systems might avoid. However, access to Grok requires users to have a verified X account. In terms of performance, Grok AI, powered by the Grok-1 large language model, has been compared favorably to ChatGPT-3.5 but falls short of OpenAI's latest model, ChatGPT-4, according to some assessments.\n\nElon Musk's decision to make Grok open source represents a significant development in the ongoing debate over the future of AI development and its implications for society.

At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty.

But that does not mean that the government will necessarily take a decision.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said that the government is working on collaborations with \"potential investors\" from Europe, the US, the Far East, Japan, and Korea. At present, the Indian EV market is dominated by local giant TATA with four models on the market.\n\nIn 2021, Musk complained on X (formerly Twitter) that India's import duties \"are the highest in the world\" and stated he was hoping for \"temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles.\" After meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the US last year, Musk claimed that the Indian leader was \"pushing [Tesla] to make significant investments\" in the country.\n\nLast year in November, Modi's office reportedly held a meeting with senior officials to fast-track Tesla's entry into the Indian market by providing \"all required approvals\" by January 2024. Later that month, Goyal visited Tesla's facility in Fremont, California and said that the company was \"on its way to double its components imports from India.\"\n\nAt the time, Goyal asserted that New Delhi wanted more investment from Tesla and a higher output of EVs in the country soon. \"[Having more EVs] will save foreign exchange, reduce our trade deficits, help us in our fight against inflation, thereby helping us in reducing interest rates,\" the minister told PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest budget, the Indian government included an initiative to focus on both manufacturing and charging infrastructure \"to fortify and broaden the landscape for electric vehicles\" as part of its strategy to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

Co-founded by LGBTQ+ activist Eric Cervini; his partner, Adam Powell, a noted drag performer; and celebrity cross-dresser RuPaul, Allstora was created to be an \"independent bookstore committed to sharing all stories and sharing profits fairly.\"\n\nNot only did Cervini, Powell, and RuPaul initially insist on giving authors a higher share of the profits from their books, but they also took a hard stance against censorship. \"At Allstora, we believe that the censorship of any book, perspective, or story is incompatible with the survival of democracy,\" its website said as recently as March 6. \"We cannot fight the ideologies of hate if we lack the ability to study, understand, and react to them.\"\n\nThat \"decision to carry all books\" angered many leftists, especially those who identify somewhere along the LGBTQ+ spectrum. LGBTQ Nation railed that Allstora dared to carry books written by \"anti-LGBTQ+ extremists,\" such as the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh; Chaya Raichik, better known on social media as Libs of TikTok, whom LGBTQ Nation called a \"hate monger\"; and Abigail Shrier, described as \"transphobic.\" Others objected to Allstora selling books by former President Donald Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nAllstora tried to quell their concerns by flagging certain titles that \"are contrary to our core values.\" The store even promised to donate all proceeds from sales of those titles \"to fight book bans.\"\n\nBut the leftist onslaught continued unabated, and Allstora folded to pressure within days. On March 9, Cervini released a full-page statement that chronicled his rapid transition from anti-censorship advocate to mob apologist.\n\n\"We envisioned a bookstore that split its profits with all authors: not just queer and trans storytellers, but also Black, Brown, disabled, neurodiverse, everyone,\" Cervini wrote. \"A place where all the infinite intersections of humanity could find their books, their people.\"\n\n\"As a historian, I understood that even the most hateful of books can have educational value,\" he continued. \"I knew that to dismantle prejudice, we must examine its illogic. We must study history so as not to repeat it, and we must understand hatred if we are to destroy it.\"\n\nBut in his attempt to understand his enemies, Cervini said he soon realized that he had unwittingly created an \"unsafe\" platform where \"queer or trans youth\" might \"accidentally stumbl[e] upon a harmful book.\"\n\n\"I confused my duties as an academic and a bookseller, and I brought pain instead of joy into the world. And for that, I am sorry,\" he said.\n\nCervini then noted that \"the most harmful books\" had been removed from Allstora's catalog and invited shoppers to \"continue to report any instances of hateful material on our site.\"\n\n\"As we continue to grow, I'm committed to doing a better job of listening and learning from the communities that we hope to nurture.

It allows permit holders to live, work and study in SA.\n\nFritz has been heavily attacked on social media because the HSF challenged the government on the ZEP.\n\nThe abuse and threats she received from one X user were particularly distressing, resulting in her taking him to court.\n\n\"While I've been a kind of central target, he's also targeted other women. The threats were extensive and fairly regular -- threats of being necklaced or real physical harm to me and my family,\" Fritz said.\n\nShe asked Daily Maverick not to publish the individual's name due to the attention it might garner him.\n\nWhile the individual did not deny the threats in court, he argued that Fritz should have understood that he didn't mean them and wouldn't have acted on them.\n\n\"He said I should have understood that, particularly because Twitter\/X had not censored him, they hadn't taken down his tweets or his accounts, and therefore there was a sense in which what he was saying, and the threats he was issuing, and the harassment was okay,\" she said.\n\nSince Elon Musk acquired Twitter\/X, any regulatory mechanisms, particularly in Africa, had been discarded, Fritz said.\n\n\"It's frightening that people will get the sense, because they're not being sanctioned or censored by X, particularly here in South Africa, that this kind of engagement, this type of intimidation, harassment is okay.\"\n\nSocial media law expert Emma Sadleir said the X user's argument that because the social media platform had not censored him his abuse was acceptable, was \"totally wrong\".\n\n\"There's a huge problem with illegal content, particularly on Twitter, but on all social media platforms. Twitter is the worst because when Elon Musk took over Twitter, he basically fired the whole moderation team,\" she said.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: X marks the spot where the fundamentals of democracy were put to the torch\n\nSadleir said it was clear to see the voyage into zero moderation with the content on the platform, including pornography and sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift.\n\n\"We do see them sometimes taking action. But there's a lot, a lot, a lot of illegal content on Twitter. Now they have so-called community guidelines and they're very badly enforced, if at all,\" she said.\n\nIn the US, the Communications Decency Act essentially provides immunity for social media companies.\n\n\"They basically say, 'Look, Twitter, Facebook, you're not responsible for the content you're hosting just because you provide the platform', and it is very controversial,\" Sadleir said.\n\n\"I've seen child sexual abuse, and child pornography on Twitter; just because it's not taken down doesn't mean it's legal.\"\n\nSadleir explained that South Africa's Protection from Harassment Act \"allows ... for somebody to get a protection order against somebody who is harassing them, threatening them, stalking them, in the real world or online.\n\n\"There's even a mechanism actually to get a protection order against an anonymous person, which is fabulous. A lot of people call this law the cyberbullying law and I've even got teenage clients who've managed to get protection orders against people who are cyberbullying them.\"\n\nThere is a threshold that must be met to obtain this.\n\n\"You have to show that there's harm or a fear of harm. It can be mental, psychological, physical or financial harm,\" Sadleir said.\n\nThe passing of the Cybercrimes Act in June 2021 has also been beneficial.\n\nThe Act criminalises a wide variety of cybercrimes, including crimes specifically associated with cyberbullying such as:\n\n\"So if I send you a text message, or a voice note or a DM [direct message] tomorrow, and then I never see you again, it's a criminal offence,\" Sadleir said.\n\nSadleir said obtaining a protection order was relatively inexpensive and simple.\n\n\"If I had to go rush off to the high court and get an interdict, that's a very expensive process. Whereas a protection order, you can literally go off to the magistrates' court, fill in a form that they give you, and get issued an interim protection order,\" she said.\n\n\"And then you all go back on the return day, and you argue why it should be made permanent and the other person (if they turn up), argues why it should not, and then if you get it, it's valid for five years.\"\n\nSadleir said each protection order is different, but it essentially means that if that person so much as sends you an SMS, again, they can be arrested.\n\n\"It has, in many instances, the effect of sort of a high court interdict, just you can do it for free. It's a much more accessible piece of law than, for example, a defamation interdict, or suing for damages. You can even download the form from the internet and fill it in at home,\" she said.\n\nFritz said the magistrate in her case was \"fantastic\" and made it clear to the individual that contravening the protection order would lead to him either facing a prison term of five years or a fine of R180,000.\n\n\"But it was more important because the social media platforms and I think particularly X, are just so negligent at this point, particularly under Musk's leadership in ensuring that it is a space for robust speech, but not speech that actually traffics in hate, intimidation, threats and harassment,\" Fritz said.\n\nShe said it was an important outcome as women, particularly women in the public eye or who assume public roles, were often subjected to vicious intimidation and harassment on social media.\n\n\"For a lot of women in similar situations, it's not clear what tools they might have available to them and what they can do to try and protect them; and whilst it's imperfect, I do think it's important that there be greater public awareness of being able to apply for this type of protective order,\" she said.

At present, factoring in cost, insurance, and freight, imported cars valued over $40,000 incur a 100% customs tax, while those under $40,000 face a 70% import duty.

She's even giving away money to nonprofits that aren't asking for money. \"I'm not stopping until the safe is empty\"\n\nThe above post, which garnered 23.6 million views and 88,000 likes, was shared widely by other users. We encountered a similar post on Instagram, which had gained more than 84,000 likes and 17,000 comments at the time of this writing:\n\nIn short, Scott has documented her donations of billions of dollars and promised to continue giving away money, so we rate this claim as \"True.\"\n\nAfter 26 years of marriage to Bezos, Scott walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, which was then worth about $37 billion (according to Forbes, she had a net worth of $35 billion as of this writing). As soon as 2020, she began to donate money to a growing list of nonprofit groups. According to her fund's website, she had completed gifts adding up to more than $16.5 billion to 1,964 groups at the time we reported this.\n\nScott has endeavored to be transparent about her philanthropic efforts. Besides shedding light on the process for awarding money to organizations, Scott wrote a series of blog posts explaining her thinking. On May 25, 2019, less than two months after her divorce from Bezos was announced, she wrote on the website of The Giving Pledge (emphasis added):\n\nWe each come by the gifts we have to offer by an infinite series of influences and lucky breaks we can never fully understand. In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share. My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care. But I won't wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.\n\nShe reiterated that pledge in July 2020, in a long post on Medium:\n\nLast year I pledged to give the majority of my wealth back to the society that helped generate it, to do it thoughtfully, to get started soon, and to keep at it until the safe is empty. There's no question in my mind that anyone's personal wealth is the product of a collective effort, and of social structures which present opportunities to some people, and obstacles to countless others.\n\nIn this post, she also listed the causes to which she had donated money in the months prior. Topping that list were the following causes (by donation amounts):\n\nWho is Bezos' ex giving money to?\n\nAccording to her fund's website, over half of the orgs to which she's donated so far deal with issues of race and\/or gender.\n\nHer fund ought to be called The AWFL Fund.

In a Feb. 7 post on X, Seyffart that May 23 is the \"only date that matters\" when it comes to Ether ETFs.\n\nFinally, it appears more people are realizing 'why' alternative currencies (like crypto and precious metals) have seen such demand recently.\n\nAs CoinTelegraph reports, in an X post on March 11, entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan argued that Bitcoin is the only realistic solution to escape the inevitability of unsustainable government spending and potential asset confiscation.\n\n\"We're in the looting-the-treasury phase of imperial collapse,\" the former Coinbase chief technology officer told his 994,000 followers.\n\nSrinivasan argued that government debt and wasteful spending continue to grow rapidly at unsustainable levels. U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020.\n\nSrinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and \"simply feed yourself at the trough,\" or:\n\n\"Starve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can't easily seize or print.\"\n\n\"The last is radical but actually realistic,\" he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.\n\n\"Debt increasing by $1 trillion every 90 days. America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin. Please take care.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Srinivasan also warned that as financial reckoning approaches, the \"ravenous state\" may consider confiscating private assets.\n\nSrinivasan offered a handful of examples, such as the seizing of assets from protesting Canadian truckers, freezing Russian assets and the \"weaponization of Delaware against Elon [Musk] and New York against [Donald] Trump.\"\n\n\"Private property will not be protected by the state in a bankrupt Blue America,\" he said before adding:\n\n\"Fortunately, we have Bitcoin, which isn't dependent on the state and can't easily be seized.\"\n\nFinaly, one headline that raised an eyebrow was that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has overtaken MicroStrategy's holdings of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data compiled by BitMEX Research, BlackRock's IBIT holds 197,943 BTC, worth over $13.5 billion as of March 8, nearly 40 trading sessions after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine new funds on Jan. 10.\n\n\"I'm going to be buying the top forever.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) shares after the company's mixed Q4 report. With production guidance implying little volume growth this year, and losses and cash burn remaining quite high, I thought there might be some additional pain to come. Last week, the company unveiled its second-generation vehicle to a tremendous amount of hype, but the recent rally in shares now has me turning negative on the name.\n\nLast Thursday was the highly awaited event where Rivian showed off its new R2 SUV. The vehicle will start at $45,000, but that appears to be a \"base\" version that will not have over 300 miles of range. Like the company's current R1 platform, you can get bigger batteries to allow for more range, but these add-ons can be very costly. It's not clear at this point if the R2 will be able to receive the full $7,500 EV tax credit. That credit also assumes the US political situation remains the same, as the election this fall could swing things that result in the credit potentially being eliminated by the time the R2 is available. As we've seen with many electric vehicles, the lowest announced priced model doesn't come right at the beginning of availability and can take several years to get depending on the company's situation.\n\nAfter the R2 unveil, I saw a lot of people calling this the \"Model 3 moment\" for Rivian, referring to when Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) launched its mass-market vehicle in 2016 after selling two luxury vehicles to that point. While that is the path that Rivian seems to be following, it's not as comparable as you might think. Tesla was calling for a $35,000 vehicle with a $7,500 tax credit, which even adjusting for the inflation we've seen since would only equate to about $36,000 today. If Rivian only gets half of the EV credit, the cheapest variant of the R2 would come in at more than $41,000. Elon Musk reported 180,000 orders for the Model 3 in the first 24 hours, with each requiring a $1,000 deposit, whereas Rivian had over 68,000 deposits down at $100 each as of Friday morning.\n\nRivian is entering a vastly different competitive situation here as well. Tesla was basically only competing with the Nissan Leaf at the time it launched the Model 3. Currently, you can get a base Tesla Model Y for $36,490 after the Federal tax credit, and it will have similar performance specs to the base R2 that is at least two years away. Last Friday, Chevy announced sales were starting again for its Blazer EV, which is quite comparable to the R2 as well, and other players like Kia, Honda, Hyundai, etc. have electric SUVs available now or coming soon.\n\nRivian also announced another model last week, the R3, which will be smaller and come after the R2. No pricing, specs, or an availability timeline were given, but this unexpected reveal was nothing more than pure hype for now. I say this because perhaps the biggest news that came out of last week was that Rivian is pausing its plans for its new Georgia factory, instead launching the R2 out of its Illinois factory in the first half of 2026. This move will save an estimated $2.25 billion between capital expenditures and operating expenses according to management. The Georgia factory will eventually come and produce the R2 and then the R3, meaning the smaller vehicle is a 2027 item at the earliest, which is why I wouldn't put much focus on it currently.\n\nRivian certainly did a 180 here, and I think it speaks to some desperation from the company as well as the financial situation being weaker than it seems. It was just a year ago at the Q4 2022 conference call that management believed it had enough cash to get through the end of 2025. Yet, Rivian went out twice last year and hit the debt markets, raising $2.8 billion in convertible debt. Unlike the Tesla Model 3 deposit surge, which brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in a week or two, Rivian's R2 deposits are likely to only bring in tens of millions at best. Tesla didn't have the cash pile that Rivian currently does back in 2016, but it wasn't burning as much, and it did produce almost 84,000 vehicles that year, as compared to Rivian's guidance for 57,000 in production in 2024.\n\nInterestingly enough, Rivian shares so far this year have shown some similar trends to Tesla in 2016. As the chart below shows, Tesla shares tanked to begin the year, which Rivian has done, before rebounding into the new model reveal. Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on March 31st, and interestingly enough, shares hit their peak for the year the next week, before falling again. Rivian has seen its shares bounce 27% from their recent low, and those gains would have been even higher if not for the overall market rally on Friday getting wiped out and then some.\n\nRivian shares have jumped about 17% since my prior article, with the S&P 500 being roughly flat over that time. The price-to-sales valuation here has ticked up slightly to 2.56 times this year's expected revenue, mostly a function of analyst estimates coming down, and was over 2.70 times at Friday's high. However, when I talked about the major discount to Tesla in my last article, Tesla was at nearly 5.6 times its expected sales. Since then, we've seen a bunch of bad news regarding Tesla, including weak China sales and its Berlin factory shut down due to an arson attack on the power grid. Tesla now only goes for about 5.1 times its expected 2024 revenue, so the valuation gap has certainly narrowed.\n\nRivian finished 2022 with total cash of more than $11.5 billion against debt of just $1.2 billion. However, due to large losses and cash burn, the company finished 2023 with cash of about $9.4 billion, but debt was also up to more than $4.4 billion. The other thing that differentiates Rivian from Tesla here is that when the Model 3 was unveiled, Tesla had a market cap of more than $30.75 billion. Even after last week's rally, Rivian's market cap stands at just $12.5 billion, meaning any capital raises are a bit more painful to swallow.\n\nGiven everything that happened last week, I am now downgrading Rivian to a sell. The valuation increase isn't justified given Tesla's valuation decrease. The R2 won't be here for at least two years, and there's a lot more competition now than when Tesla launched its mass-market Model 3. I believe another capital raise will come, and it's possible that last week's unveil was set up just to prepare for that. The pausing of the Georgia factory does ding the growth story in the medium term, even while saving some money, and the R3 will be several years off. Investors are now going to focus on the current business, and Rivian is about to shut down its plant for upgrades that will pressure revenues in the near term. It remains to be seen if last week's reveal will thus pressure sales of the current lineup as consumers wait for the R2, and how the addition of leasing options for the R1 line will impact the financials.\n\nFor me to bring my rating back to a hold, I need to see a couple of things happen. First, I need to see Rivian get through this plant upgrade period and show that it has resulted in the cost savings that management expects. Getting to gross profits in Q4 will be tough given the company hasn't had gross margins better than negative 36% in any quarter recently. Second, I need to see the company raise more capital to de-risk the balance sheet through the start of the R2 launch and to get the Georgia factory plans back on track. Finally, I need to see the valuation improve a bit, given all the weakness we've seen in EV stocks in recent months. Should the price-to-sales figure come down to around 2 times this year's expected revenues, I would consider looking at my rating again.\n\nIn conclusion, the hype and rally in Rivian shares surrounding last week's R2 unveil is not warranted in my opinion. The company's cheaper SUV won't be here for at least two years and enters a much tougher EV landscape than when Tesla launched the Model 3. Tesla shares peaked the week after its major reveal, falling back to reality as investors went back to scrutinizing how the actual business was doing. With Rivian's valuation rising ahead of a potential capital raise, I think investors should step aside here.\n\nI am a market enthusiast and part-time trader.

As a software developer working on bank treasury and blockchain applications, I'm a big proponent of blockchain technology's potential. However, my enthusiasm is not blind to the limitations and problems found in specific blockchain implementations.\n\nBitcoin's 2017 highs, brought my attention to what I consider a critical flaw in Bitcoin's use of the proof-of-work algorithm. Bitcoin's excessive energy consumption makes it unsustainable for use as a major cryptocurrency or a store of value. Though I have followed many discussions addressing Bitcoin's energy consumption since then, some by prominent figures such as Cathie Wood and Elon Musk, I believe the issue remains fundamentally misunderstood. Instead of preserving value, Bitcoin's inherent design paradoxically destroys it. And no one seems to care.\n\nIn this article, I will try to analyse this flaw, challenge the prevailing narratives and offer a perspective based on thought experiments and empirical evidence.\n\nBefore we get to the promised thought experiment, let's summarize how Bitcoin works. We will focus only on the key points crucial to our discussion.\n\nBitcoin is a distributed network of specialized computers (nodes). Each node collects pending transactions, groups them into a block, and locks the block with a special cryptographic hash. A valid hash is very specific in such a way that it can't be simply computed but needs to be guessed. This guessing requires lots of trials and errors, and these trials require substantial computational power.\n\nAfter successfully discovering a valid hash, a node broadcasts the new block to the network. The Bitcoin network then verifies the block and appends it to the blockchain. With this, all transactions in the block become valid - executed. The node that found the valid hash is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. This process is also known as mining, and the node is a miner. In addition to the newly mined Bitcoins, the successful node also receives transaction fees from the transactions included in the block.\n\nTypically, a block contains around 2,500 transactions. The total reward includes a fixed number of newly mined Bitcoins plus the transaction fees. On average, one block is produced every 10 minutes.\n\nThe Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty of the hash, that is required to secure the block, to maintain these 10 minutes per block timing, regardless of how much computational power is available. Simply said, if the blocks of transactions are being generated too fast, the Bitcoin algorithm increases the hash difficulty, which in turn requires more computational power to guess the right hash and thus requires more time. Restoring the average 10-minute interval between blocks.\n\nAs of today, the mining reward is 6.25 BTC, and total fees per block range between 0.1 BTC and 1 BTC. To keep it simple, let's say that the total reward per block is 7 BTC.\n\nTo summarize: approximately every 10 minutes, a new block is created, containing around 2,500 transactions and giving the miner approximately 7 BTC in revenue.\n\nLet's do a thought experiment to show how the economics of Bitcoin mining and its energy consumption work. Imagine we have set up a mining operation big enough to consistently mine one block a day. For simplicity, we will assume our daily mining revenue is 7 BTC. Given Bitcoin's current valuation of $65,000 per BTC, our operation would bring around $455,000 in revenues daily.\n\nTo determine our profit, let's for the sake of an argument assume a 20% profit margin. This is a reasonable assumption given the competitiveness of Bitcoin mining. If profits were significantly higher, it would attract more miners, increasing the network's computational power. This influx would increase the mining difficulty, as Bitcoin's protocol adjusts to maintain the average block time at ten minutes, consequently diminishing profit margins. Conversely, if mining was less profitable, miners would exit the industry, reducing competition and difficulty. Those who would remain could enjoy higher margins.\n\nWith 20% being our profit margin, the remaining 80% are our operational costs. These are costs for energy consumption and hardware amortisation. Simplifying further, we can assume that the bulk of hardware expenses ultimately translates into additional energy consumption, considering the energy required to mine, transport and transform natural resources to the required hardware. For simplicity, let's thus say that 80% of the mining reward is spent on energy consumption.\n\nOur operations would then every day collect revenue of $455.000, earn $91.000 of profit, and spend $364.000 on energy.\n\nExpanding our analysis to the entire Bitcoin network, which generates approximately 144 blocks daily (24 hours x 6 blocks per hour), we find that the collective daily revenue for all miners amounts to around $65.5 million. Correspondingly, energy expenses sum up to approximately $52.4 million, which translates to about $19 billion annually in energy costs.\n\n$19 billion worth of electric energy a year? Is this too much? In an era where billions are routinely cited in media reports, consider Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, we might become indifferent to such large and abstract numbers. The tendency is to rationalize these enormous figures as justified for a system as significant as Bitcoin.\n\nYet, these costs are ridiculously high when put into perspective. Consider the energy cost per transaction: If an average block encapsulates about 2,500 transactions, with each block incurring $364,000 in energy expenses, the cost per transaction amounts to $145. This expense is extraordinary, especially when considering that Bitcoin, a non-physical asset, could ostensibly cost more to move digitally than sending a physical package across continents.\n\nWhile individual users don't directly bear the full $145 transaction fee, since it's offset by the creation of new Bitcoins, effectively diluting the currency pool, the energy consumed remains real. To offer another comparison, this amount far exceeds what some modern digital banks spend to serve a customer for an entire month, which costs to serve around $1. (check NU Holdings 2023 Q4 Earnings Call Presentation)\n\nLooking ahead to Bitcoin's future, let's reference a prediction from ARK Invest's CEO.\n\nIf we adapt our model to this scenario, even as the block reward declines due to halving (to 1.56 BTC per block by 2030, rounded up to 1.6 BTC with the transaction fees), our mining operation's revenue per block would grow to $2.4 million, and our daily energy costs soaring to $1.92 million for our single operation. Extrapolating to the entire network, this would result in daily revenues of $345.6 million and energy costs of $276.5 million. $101 billion worth of energy is spent annually!\n\nAt $0.05 per kWh, $101 billion equates to approximately 2,018 TWh of electric energy. To provide context, according to Statista, net electricity consumption worldwide in 2022 amounted to around 25,500 TWh. Thus, if Bitcoin hits Cathie Wood's forecasted price of $1,500,000 by 2030, its energy consumption would constitute about 8% of worldwide electric energy production. Should Bitcoin reach this price point earlier, say by 2028, its energy usage would escalate to 16% of global production, factoring in Bitcoin halving effects. One might wonder if Cathie Wood actually understands the implications of her forecast.\n\nThe relationship between Bitcoin's price, the revenues earned by miners, and the energy consumed are direct: as the price increases, so do miners' earnings and consequently, their energy expenditures. When Bitcoin's price reaches sufficiently high levels, it could potentially monopolize affordable energy resources, diverting them from other vital economic and societal needs. Persisting in this energy-intensive endeavour is foolish under any circumstances, but especially so in the context of looming ecological crises. To amplify such a \"doom spiral\" when facing potential environmental collapse is unmistakably self-destructive.\n\nLet's now examine if empirical evidence aligns with the conclusions of our thought experiment.\n\nFirst, we refer to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which estimates the annual power demand of the Bitcoin network at current Bitcoin prices to be 163 TWh, with a theoretical upper limit of 394 TWh. Translated into dollars at $0.05 per kWh, this equates to a range of $8 billion to $24.7 billion. The results of our thought experiment, where we estimated yearly energy consumption worth $19 billion, fall within the upper range provided by the University of Cambridge. Particularly since our experiment considers the total energy footprint, including the energy input in hardware manufacturing, whereas Cambridge's figures predominantly account for operational energy usage.\n\nFor additional insights, let's turn to the Bitcoin Mining Calculator, which assesses the profitability of various mining hardware setups it sells.\n\nSome devices show profit margins as high as 80%, suggesting that only 20% of revenues are spent on electricity. At first sight, these numbers contradict our thought experiment's assumptions. However, this discrepancy can be attributed to two main factors.\n\nFirst, the most recent and efficient mining hardware can indeed temporarily achieve higher profit margins for miners, but as this advanced hardware becomes the standard, the network's overall mining difficulty adjusts, normalizing profit margins. With the increasing mining difficulty, the efficiency of specific hardware declines over time, aligning long-term profitability more closely with the 20% margin hypothesized in our experiment rather than the initial 80% figure. Eventually, the hardware's profit margin becomes negative, and the miners dispose of it.\n\nThe second factor is Bitcoin's price volatility. The Bitcoin price is currently spiking, and price surges enhance miners' revenue without increasing operational costs, thus inflating short-term profitability. However, as the network adapts to these changes through more miners joining the fray and consequent increased difficulty, profit margins normalize. Conversely, a rapid decline in Bitcoin's price can render mining temporarily unprofitable.\n\nIn summary, the empirical data largely corroborates the premises and outcomes of our thought experiment. While specific circumstances or cutting-edge hardware can temporarily boost profitability, the long-term economic equilibrium of Bitcoin mining tends towards a scenario where a significant majority of mining revenue, around 80% or more, is allocated to energy costs.\n\nEnergy Innovation Feedback Loop Argument: Bitcoin advocates often say that energy innovations will mitigate Bitcoin's excessive energy consumption. However, imagine a breakthrough that would bring 10 times more energy at 1\/10th the costs. What would this do to our hypothetical mining operations? Initially, our mining costs would drop to 8%, boosting our profits to 92%. Yet, this would attract more miners, intensifying competition and increasing the mining difficulty. Ultimately, the network's energy consumption would multiply 10 times to balance out the reduced costs. Bitcoin, by design, requires that significant resources are consumed (wasted) as proof in its proof of work algorithm. So no matter how abundant or cheap some energy source might be, Bitcoin will consume so much of it, as to make the spent significant in respect to Bitcoins price. Otherwise, the security of its proof of work consensus mechanism can't be guaranteed.\n\nGreen Energy Argument: There are indeed Bitcoin mining operations using renewable energy. This doesn't inherently negate the broader environmental impact. Renewable energy used for mining is energy not used elsewhere in the economy, serving more critical and essential needs. Bitcoin advocates would argue that these mining operations are in remote regions, where there is no other use for the energy. This is also wrong. It fails to consider global energy dynamics and the transportability of energy-intensive processes like data centres, particularly the very recent and power-hungry AI or the emerging direct CO2 air capture technologies.\n\nMore Efficient Hardware Argument: As we have discussed in the empirical evidence section, the newest Bitcoin mining hardware always appears quite efficient and shows a mining profit margin of around 80%, which leads many people to believe that as newer devices get introduced, Bitcoin mining will become more efficient and will consume less energy. This is the wrong conclusion. The newest hardware is only comparatively efficient, and as other miners upgrade to the same or better hardware, the network difficulty increases, and a particular piece of mining hardware becomes less efficient. Again, Bitcoin's design mandates that significant resources are consumed (wasted) as proof in its proof of work algorithm. Bitcoin's mining can't be made efficient by design.\n\nBitcoin Comparison to Gold: Bitcoin is often compared to gold, with the conclusion that it is just like gold, only better. It is a digital asset, with all the benefits that come with it when storing and transacting it. Indeed, the similarities are quite stinking. But the analogy between Bitcoin and gold fails in at least one critical aspect. While both assets' mining costs are influenced by their market prices, gold retains its value independently of its mining status. You can stop mining gold and the value of the gold already mined will hold its value, possibly even appreciate more. Conversely, stopping Bitcoin mining would paralyse its network, stripping the currency of its value since transactions would no longer be processed. This critical difference underlines a fundamental flaw in treating Bitcoin as 'digital gold.'\n\nBitcoin's Unique Value Proposition: Bitcoin is often considered as one of its kind, pioneering cryptocurrency with a unique value proposition. When scrutinized, it's apparent that other cryptocurrencies, particularly those using proof of stake consensus algorithm, offer similar or better functionality without the environmental impact. For instance, Ethereum, with its proof of stake algorithm, consumes a stunning 28,000 times (yes, twenty-eight thousand times) less energy than Bitcoin (6 GWh vs. 170 TWh). Bitcoin's value is largely narrative-driven, supported by its status and market momentum rather than irreplaceable utility. Transitioning to less energy-intensive cryptocurrencies could yield similar benefits without the associated environmental costs.\n\nBitcoin Reward Halving Argument: The halving of Bitcoin rewards is considered a future solution to its environmental impact. However, this argument overlooks the fact that Bitcoin's value has historically risen faster than the halving rate, maintaining or even increasing the incentive for energy-intensive mining. Relying on an asset whose environmental impact depends on its price not growing too rapidly presents a paradoxical situation, especially when the asset is supposed to serve as a store of value.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin ETFs: Investors concerned about Bitcoin's energy consumption might assume that buying a Bitcoin ETF is not a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain itself and therefore does not contribute to Bitcoin energy consumption. As we have shown in this article, this is a wrong conclusion. Purchasing a Bitcoin ETF directly affects Bitcoin's price, and as we have seen, Bitcoin's price is the single most important factor linearly driving Bitcoin's energy consumption.\n\nBitcoin's energy consumption increases dramatically with its price: at $65,000, it consumes around $52 million worth of energy daily. Should its value double to $130,000, the daily energy spent doubles to $104 million. At a valuation of $1,500,000 by 2030, these costs would be $276 million daily or $101 billion annually. This would represent around 8% of the world's current annual electric energy consumption.\n\nMany Bitcoin investors might not fully understand that its energy consumption scales linearly with its price. Such a characteristic is undesirable for a digital currency and counterintuitive for an asset meant to serve as a store of value. In their quest to preserve and grow their wealth, Bitcoin investors are unintentionally inflicting damage on the very fabric of society that bestows value upon their assets. This scenario strikingly resembles the fate of Easter Island's civilization: their relentless endeavour to erect moai statues ultimately caused both environmental degradation and societal downfall.\n\nEventually, it is likely that either investors or regulators will acknowledge this fundamental flaw in Bitcoin, potentially triggering a rapid devaluation.\n\nMy analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin is an unsustainable store of value and a technically outdated digital currency. Its long-term intrinsic value, considering these factors, will eventually trend towards zero. Each day, Bitcoin maintains a significant valuation that contributes to societal and environmental damage. Therefore, Bitcoin and its ETFs should get a \"strong sell\" rating.\n\nHowever, I understand that markets can remain detached from rational evaluations for extended periods. Most investors seek pragmatic and actionable advice rather than an idealistic appraisal. Hence, a \"sell\" rating is advised for pragmatic purposes.\n\nInvestors should gradually sell out of their Bitcoin positions, minimising regrets from missing on the current uptrend, and gradually shift their funds to different assets. If investors want to have exposure to cryptocurrencies, they should strictly avoid all the proof-of-work crypto coins.\n\nThe simplifications and rounding errors that I have made during the analysis do not materially alter the overall conclusions. Moreover, the thesis is supported by empirical evidence. Still, it is possible, that I have made an error in my reasoning. I encourage readers to critically examine my reasoning and identify any significant errors that could materially impact conclusions.\n\nThe other possible \"flaw\" could be a fundamental change in Bitcoin's protocol, such as a migration to a proof of stake consensus algorithm, similar to Ethereum's transition. But that would not be a flaw of this thesis but a positive development towards Bitcoin's sustainability. The question though is, how would such a transformation affect Bitcoin's value? Given Bitcoin's status as the 'first and true' cryptocurrency and its value being narrative-driven, a shift to proof of stake would probably trigger a significant devaluation.", "source":{"uri":"seekingalpha.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Seeking Alpha"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/static.seekingalpha.com\/cdn\/s3\/uploads\/getty_images\/1324841462\/image_1324841462.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.3568627450980393, "wgt":447881009, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"2024-03-285569580", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:21:07", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:21:07Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:08:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8274509906768799, "url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/tech\/news\/trump-confirms-he-met-with-elon-musk-but-they-disagree-about-electric-cars\/articleshow\/108409224.cms", "title":"Trump confirms he met with Elon Musk, but they disagree about electric cars", "body":"Elon Musk's support for electric vehicle production may be a sticking point between him and the campaign of former president Donald Trump.PATRICK PLEUL\/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump may be courting Elon Musk for potential campaign support, but don't expect the former president to change his messaging on EVs anytime soon.\n\nTrump confirmed that he met with the Tesla CEO recently in an interview on CNBC's SquawkBox on Monday, but said he didn't know whether he would eventually receive Musk's endorsement.\n\nHe added that, while he personally likes the Tesla CEO, the two are \"obviously\" not on the same page when it comes to \"a minor subject called electric cars.\"\n\n\"They don't go far, they cost too much, and they're all going to be made in China,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trump said he is \"all for\" EV production, he suggested that an all-electric future is impractical in the short term due to the state of the US electric grid, which he described as \"obsolete and a disaster.\"\n\n\"You have to have all of the alternatives,\" he said.\n\n\"Electric cars -- there's not even the possibility to go all-electric,\" he added. \"This Biden all-electric mandate is by very, very stupid people.\"\n\nThe former president was presumably referring to his successor's push to ramp up EV production to 60% of new vehicles by 2030. Those targets, announced last year, are reportedly being loosened thanks to lagging EV sales recently.\n\nThe Biden administration has also invested in billion-dollar efforts to strengthen the power grid and expand the availability of charging networks.\n\nTrump made headlines on Christmas for a post on Truth Social where he said that supporters of \"Electric Car Lunacy,\" among others, are \"THUGS\" who can \"ROT IN HELL.\" Trump posted the message, which also mentioned \"No Energy Independence\" and the \"Green New Scam,\" as he lashed out against the criminal charges he faces.\n\nTrump met with Musk in Palm Beach, Florida, last week, as he looks to boost donations to his presidential campaign. Musk later said that he would not donate money to \"either candidate for US president\" -- though some are unconvinced.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Musk served on two presidential advisory councils but left after Trump elected to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that Trump's links to the oil and gas industry limited his support of EV manufacturers like Tesla during his presidency. Musk also claimed he voted for Biden, not Trump, in 2020 -- though, according to his biographer, he actually stayed home on Election Day. In May 2022, Musk said he planned on voting Republican in \"this election,\" but didn't specify if he meant the midterms or the 2024 presidential election. Later that year, he said he was undecided on whether he'd vote for Trump.\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from criticizing Musk in recent years. In 2022, Trump said the tech billionaire had come to the White House asking for help \"on all of his many subsidized projects,\" including his \"electric cars that don't drive long enough,\" his \"driverless cars that crash,\" and his \"rocketships to nowhere.\"\n\n\"I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" the former president said at the time.\n\nTrump on Monday acknowledged the United Auto Workers recently endorsed President Biden's campaign -- adding that union leaders were \"like blind sheep.\" Nevertheless, he asserted that \"the autoworkers are going to vote for Trump.\"", "source":{"uri":"businessinsider.in", "dataType":"news", "title":"Business Insider India"}, "authors":[{"uri":"camilo_fonseca@businessinsider.in", "name":"Camilo Fonseca", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/photo\/108409224\/trump-confirms-he-met-with-elon-musk-but-they-disagree-about-electric-cars.jpg?imgsize=366330", "eventUri":"eng-9384448", "sentiment":0.003921568627450966, "wgt":447880867, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023548200", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:20:23", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:20:23Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:18:40Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5843137502670288, "url":"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2024-03-12\/return-of-the-hybrid-ev-battery-technology-critical-minerals\/103574604", "title":"Why petrol is making a temporary comeback in the battle with EVs", "body":"Amidst the political furore and fallout from the recent split among leading auto manufacturers over Australia's new emissions control laws, a deeper chasm is developing over electric vehicle technology.\n\nIt is a battle that could ultimately determine the future of our budding new mining quest; the search for and supply of critical minerals. More on that later.\n\nGiven the relative infancy of the shift towards an electric future, the means of achieving that end are likely to shift dramatically as technology improves and is overtaken.\n\nDebate still rages over whether hydrogen will be the fuel of the future or whether battery power will supply our energy needs.\n\nAnd within the world of batteries, a range of materials and technologies are vying for dominance.\n\nIt's highly likely no single technology will emerge as a universal solution. It could well be that hydrogen will power larger vehicles, ships and aircraft with batteries the best placed for passenger vehicles.\n\nBut the recent crash in the price of critical minerals has delivered a wake-up call to those who merely had assumed that lithium, nickel and cobalt will dominate the future and those who assumed the path towards a lower emissions future would be a straight line.\n\nA strange thing happened late last year.\n\nAmerican car buyers lost interest in electric vehicles and instead began switching back to hybrids, vehicles that use a combination of petrol powered internal combustion engines and electric motors.\n\nThe trend began about this time last year but really gathered pace towards the end of 2023 as this graph from investment bank Morgan Stanley shows. The red line shows fully electric vehicles started the year with phenomenal growth. By March, however, hybrids began a resurgence which continued through to the end of the year.\n\nUS consumers bought a record one million hybrids last year, a 76 per cent increase from the previous year when it appeared Americans had tired of the quarter century old technology and were making the jump to battery powered automobiles.\n\nWhile electric vehicles still account for about a million new car sales in the US, the growth sputtered in 2023.\n\nExactly why is difficult to pin down. Concerns about refuelling and the higher prices of battery powered vehicles dominate the reasoning. But it has been enough for some major producers either to scale back plans to fully convert to battery power or consider a longer term shift to hybrids.\n\nFord is talking about a dramatic increase in hybrid production while General Motors, which abandoned hybrids five years ago in favour of battery powered electrics, is mulling a re-run of its shelved hybrid technology.\n\nBoth Detroit majors appear flummoxed about which way to turn. They've been wedged between Tesla - still the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles - and Toyota which has embarked on a path to maintain internal combustion engines either through hybrids or hydrogen.\n\nThe trend back to hybrids has yet to take hold either in Europe or China. But if it becomes entrenched, even if solely in the US, it could be enough to derail projections about the medium term demand for minerals vital for battery production.\n\nOr it could just speed up the innovation behind battery design and production.\n\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Elon Musk's Tesla is still the king. But the crown is slipping.\n\nIt remains the biggest manufacturer of battery powered cars but only by a whisker. In January, it accounted for 17 per cent of global sales with Chinese giant BYD hard on its heels with 16 per cent and GM a distant third with 7 per cent.\n\nWhile growth is stagnating in America, globally sales continue to grow strongly with a 55 per cent increase in January compared with the previous January. China dominates demand with Europe bringing in the silver and the US lagging behind in third place.\n\nIn each region, Tesla maintained a dominant sales position in the first month of this year.\n\nWhile Musk outwardly portrays a disdain for investment markets, he is coming under pressure. At $US175 a share, Tesla's share price is less than half its 2021 peak when it traded at $US407.\n\nThat's eaten into his personal wealth. No longer is he the richest person strutting the planet. That title now rests with Amazon's Jeff Bezos.\n\nChip shortages, production delays and increased competition forced him to continuously slash vehicle prices throughout 2023, which ate into margins and earnings.\n\nThe price of Tesla's Model Y was 26 per cent lower in December than the start of the year, a trend that is likely to continue as Chinese manufacturers ramp up production of cheaper models for the home market.\n\nBut that US shift back to hybrids has also forced Musk's hand.\n\nTransport accounts for about 17 per cent of all Australian carbon emissions, making it the third biggest after coal fired electricity generation and gas.\n\nNot surprisingly, the recent changes to emissions standards on new cars relates directly to the climate commitments made by the Morrison government, resulting in a split amongst Australia's automotive lobby.\n\nTesla and electric vehicle rival Polestar both have left the organisation, arguing the group is running a campaign designed to impede the new standards.\n\nSimultaneously, a new front has broken out in the war against electric vehicles with a strong campaign among some sections of the media that electric vehicles require large amounts of energy intensive material for their manufacture and aren't as good for the environment as they make out.\n\nFurther arguments are that, because the batteries make the vehicles heavier, particle pollution from brakes and tyres are more intensive than in petrol cars.\n\nWhile those arguments have some merit, they ignore one crucial fact. Electric vehicles don't emit carbon dioxide, the key ingredient influencing climate change. And as the grid becomes less reliant on coal fired electricity generation, emissions from two of our biggest sources will be gradually reduced.\n\nNot all batteries are created equal.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two main types, Lithium ion and lithium-ferrous-phosphate. And just to complicate things, there are two main types of lithium-ion batteries, nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA).\n\nNMC batteries are the most popular because they have high energy density, and charge performance.\n\nBut there are questions over whether the reliance on such expensive and unsustainable materials can be maintained given the expected growth rates of battery powered vehicles. They also have a relatively short life cycle.\n\nNCA batteries use less cobalt and no manganese, replaced by more sustainable aluminium. But they have been waning in popularity from manufacturers as this graph below shows.\n\nThe battery that is gaining traction, particularly since 2021, is the lithium-ferrous-phosphate (LFP) model as shown by the orange bar. It's cheaper, longer lasting and catches fire less easily. But it's heavier and still relies upon lithium.\n\nImportantly, it has no cobalt, nickel or manganese.\n\nAnd that's where the debate over the future of critical minerals gets interesting. The rapid shift in battery technology in the past decade is likely to continue.\n\nIf LFP batteries continue to gain momentum, what was believed just a few years ago to be the need for copious quantities of nickel, may evaporate and make the recent nickel bust look like a mild correction.\n\nThen there is lithium. Vast amounts of cash have been invested in the search and production, including a 50 per cent investment lift last year.\n\nSince 2018, China has been on the hunt for lithium supplies to feed its appetite for electric vehicles, snapping up half the lithium mines on the market while the US government has been determined to counter Beijing's efforts with massive subsidies and investment.\n\nBut even its future as a critical mineral may be limited. Already, Chinese manufacturer BYD is building LFP batteries using sodium instead of lithium with plans to install it in its low cost Seagull model.\n\nLonger term, an even greater threat looms. Work is underway on solid state batteries, that are lighter, longer range, faster charging and with less fire risk.\n\nThey may be here as early as 2030. Which could burn a hole in the critical minerals boom completely.", "source":{"uri":"abc.net.au", "dataType":"news", "title":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au\/9156af23dfd0c06b4178dbf59267d389?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3375&cropW=6000&xPos=0&yPos=616&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic", "eventUri":"eng-9383890", "sentiment":-0.04313725490196074, "wgt":447880823, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285566292", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:16:46", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:16:46Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:09:22Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6352941393852234, "url":"https:\/\/cleantechnica.com\/2024\/03\/11\/apple-car-resembled-volkswagen-id-buzz-canoo-lifestyle-designs\/", "title":"Apple Car Resembled Volkswagen ID.Buzz & Canoo Lifestyle Designs - CleanTechnica", "body":"Now that Apple has officially ended its Project Titan electric car program (at least until it decides to revive it some time in the future), details about what went on and what went wrong inside the cloistered halls of Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, are beginning to emerge.\n\nBloomberg News correspondent Mark Gurman has been made privy to some of those details and they describe a series of dubious decisions, and course reversals that seem contrary to the public image of Apple as a modern day tech juggernaut that has all the answers to all the questions about the future of digital technology.\n\nGurman says the Apple car was a case study in what happens when corporate indecision, technological challenges, and market realities combine -- a wasted opportunity that set back the company's future. Beginning in 2014, Apple developed a plan that would diversify revenue and chart a future beyond the iPhone in one full swoop: an electric vehicle.\n\nThere were two main schools of thought about how to proceed:\n\nA. Build an electric vehicle with autonomy features similar to what Tesla was doing. That meant a car that could drive itself on freeways and some roads, but not everywhere.\n\nB. Change the world with a full-blown self-driving vehicle capable of taking passengers from point A to point B with zero intervention from a driver. Oh, and while doing all that, make it look like nothing seen before.\n\nApple & The Road Not Taken\n\nApple picked the second approach, a decision that meant the project was doomed from the start. Back then, everyone thought self-driving cars were just around the corner, metaphorically speaking. Elon Musk was the primary promoter of autonomous cars, but many other automakers were hooked on the idea. Why?\n\nMoney, gentle reader. At around that time, a Volvo engineer, in an unguarded moment, bragged that self-driving cars would be a license to print money for manufacturers. Why sell a car once when you could profit every day from selling subscription services that would allow cars to drive themselves? People would surely be willing to pay for such convenience.\n\nGurman says Apple was feeling pretty cocky in 2014. It had just upended the cellphone, tablet, and music industries. It was about to launch the Apple Watch, which it thought would crush the Swiss watch market. Apple wanted to do the same thing for cars.\n\nWith that in mind, Apple decided its car, in addition to offering advanced levels of autonomy, would break new ground when it came to what a car should look like. It could be a showcase for its vaunted Jony Ivy-inspired design language and be fully integrated into its ecosystem of products, which meant it would be hugely profitable for Apple.\n\nCleanTechnica readers will recall the tussle between Elon Musk and Tim Cook back in those days before production hell and cheap cars from China were just clouds on a distant horizon. Elon once crowed that Apple was where former Tesla engineers went to die. Then in the dark days when it seemed like Tesla might not survive, Tim Cook refused to take Elon's phone calls when Musk was frantically trying to find a buyer for Tesla.\n\nBusiness is not always about the triple net bottom line. Often it is just a good old fashioned game of King of the Mountain, or what a friend of mine refers to slyly as a \"d*ck measuring contest.\"\n\nWhen the decision was first made to pursue an Apple car, it seemed like the automotive market would be the next battleground for Silicon Valley, especially in the area of autonomous cars. It was also clear that cars were essentially becoming computers on wheels.\n\nThe world of personal transportation seemed like a category ripe for disruption, one that could be transformed with a smartly packaged combination of hardware, software, and services. The company could design the coolest looking car on the road, develop its own underlying operating system, and sell services on top of it -- services like self-driving features, Apple Music, and TV+ video streaming.\n\nBy the time Apple realized its mistake a few years ago, it was too late, Gurman says. All the design work had focused on a car meant to have no steering wheel or pedals. The company also had sunk billions of dollars into developing a Level 5 self-driving system. The die was cast.\n\nA source inside Apple told Gurman it was as if Apple had tried to skip all the early iPhone models and jump right to the iPhone X. Instead of just planting a flag in the ground with a good car featuring an Apple user interface, slick Jony Ive-designed interior and exterior, and an iPhone-like buying experience, the company bet everything on the wrong horse -- autonomy.\n\nIndecision In High Places At Apple\n\nProject Titan, the code name Apple choose for its iCar venture, was beset by indecision and disagreement and technological challenges from the start. And that was before the cold hard realities of what it takes to actually manufacture automobiles kicked in.\n\nTim Cook and other executives disagreed on what strategy to pursue, including whether to build a car at all, but also on minutia like what gee-whiz gizmos should be included in the car's interior. A major point of contention was what level of autonomy to give the car. The scale ranges from 0 to 5, and Apple's goals shifted several times throughout the project. At the same time, prospects for the overall EV market dimmed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, scrapping Apple's car project wasn't a mistake, especially since it frees up resources to focus on new generative AI features. But it's still a massive disappointment that will alter the course of the company's history, perhaps for decades to come.\n\nA Dymaxion For The 21st Century\n\nAccording to sources, the Apple car design in 2020 resembled the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle -- a futuristic van with rounded edges that reminds many people of the ill fated but groundbreaking Dymaxion created by Buckminster Fuller -- the inventor of the geodesic dome -- in 1933. Unlike the Canoo, the Apple concept had dark black windows with an adjustable tint. There was an all glass sunroof, a pure white exterior, and whitewall tires with a black center. The front and back were identical, so it would always look like you were driving forward. It looked like no other mass-produced vehicle -- and was optimized for full, Level 5 self-driving.\n\nThough the car's interior changed several times, the general idea was a minimalist interface, combined with seats you'd normally see on a private jet or a limousine. Inside, it felt like you were essentially in a \"contoured bubble,\" the sources said. This version of the car could comfortably accommodate four people with the seats being able to convert from being normal chairs to recliners complete with foot rests.\n\nMany of the interior designs included a giant TV in the center to show videos and handle FaceTime. Other variations added iPad-sized displays suspended from the roof to access frequent controls. Apple even went as far as devising a special air conditioning system that would push the flow of air along the sides of the cabin like airplanes do rather than being projected into the faces of the passengers.\n\nAn early design created by the legendary Jony Ive looked like a modern reincarnation of the original Volkswagen microbus -- which itself bears more than a passing resemblance to the Buckminster Fuller Dymaion. That concept was known internally as the Bread Loaf. The second concept design looked nearly identical to the 2017 Volkswagen ID.Buzz prototype.\n\nThat design was shown off inside Apple well before VW ever announced its concept, and that may not be a coincidence. Gurman says some employees left the Apple car group for the German automaker in the mid-2010s. A third variation of the Apple car kept the same overall design, but had a far more dramatic front -- like a wedge pointed downward.\n\nThe fourth version was the model that looked more like the Canoo and brought fresh excitement to the project in 2020. Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams were so impressed with the design that they gave a speech at Apple's test track in Arizona and committed to push headlong into development.\n\nThe car's last major design, which was still a variation on the original Bread Loaf idea, swapped the van-like sliding doors for rear doors similar to the falcon wing doors featured on the Tesla Model X. Even more so than with prior iterations, it wasn't designed for a traditional driver. It featured a front and back with such dramatic pinched curves that there was little room for front or rear windows.\n\nWhen Apple ultimately decided to switch from Level 5 autonomy to something more like Level 2, it needed to add back a steering wheel and pedals as well as front and back windows. By the end, the car had two seats facing forward that could swivel, something that was extremely popular in the vans Detroit manufactured in the 70s.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMy old Irish grandmother might say that Apple was too clever by half. The Apple car project was driven partly by ego -- the desire to beat Elon Musk and Tesla to the goal of manufacturing an automobile that could drive itself. As mentioned above, that goal is mostly about generating revenue for corporations. The allure of all those profits have blinded many corporations to the main goal of the EV revolution -- getting millions of electric cars on the road so emissions from driving are substantially reduced.\n\nIf Apple wants to get into the car business, it could buy an existing company like Rivian or Canoo or form a partnership with an automaker the way Sony has done with Honda. It has enough cash on hand to buy just about any company it wants, including Tesla.\n\nApple made a decision to pursue autonomous cars a decade ago.

It also has a tendency to have its wheels ripped off, and has repeatedly gotten ensnared by mild hazards like a sandy beach.\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claim that the vehicle's thick, stainless steel exoskeleton is bulletproof comes with some notable caveats. As YouTuber Zack Nelson from his channel JerryRigEverything found out in a recent video, rounds of a variety of sizes have no trouble at all penetrating the steel.\n\nWhether any of that even matters in the first place is another debate entirely -- after all, who in their right mind needs their pickup to be bulletproof? Besides, attackers could simply target the vehicle's windows instead, which are far more vulnerable.\n\nTo be fair, a .50-caliber gun, the biggest round tested out by Nelson in his video, is a ludicrous uncommon weapon -- and a lot more powerful than the Tommy gun Musk unloaded on a Cybertruck late last year.\n\nBut even smaller rounds like the .17 Hornady Mangum Rimfire round, which travels at over 2,000 feet per second -- roughly twice the velocity of a handgun round -- made it past the stainless steel, Nelson found. An AR round that travels at over 3,000 feet per second also pierced both the stainless steel and the Cybertruck's interior door panel.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the much larger .50 caliber round had zero issues either.\n\n\"I can see through the truck from here,\" Nelson said in his video before examining the half-inch hole in the truck's door. \"That's wild.\"\n\n\"Still, slowing down a bullet is still infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle,\" he concluded.\n\nSo there we have it.

Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behaviour could prove legally pivotal.\n\n\"If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,\" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot. Tesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill declined to comment. Anderson did not respond to requests. Both have left Tesla. McNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Anderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNearly 1000 crashes\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of US accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use.\n\nThe agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts. The fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving. \"There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,\" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves. It disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up \"enhanced\" Autopilot, which costs US$6000 ($9078), adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features.\n\nThe US$12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'Ready to take control'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law.\n\nThe former Tesla president's message, he said, \"corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles\".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript. Reuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behaviour.\n\nAfter a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n\"Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,\" he said. \"It is not the neophytes.\"\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions. Autopilot might make an \"unexpected steering input\" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver \"is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake\".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any research specifically,\" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n\"I cannot,\" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLulled into distraction\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: \"Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.\"\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n\"The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,\" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman. \"I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.\"\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers \"adhere to their continuous driving responsibility\".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading US product-testing companies.\n\nIts road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n\"Autopilot usually does a good job,\" Funkhouser said. \"It rarely fails, but it does fail.\"", "source":{"uri":"itnews.com.au", "dataType":"news", "title":"iTnews"}, "authors":[{"uri":"hyunjoo_jin@itnews.com.au", "name":"Hyunjoo Jin", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/i.nextmedia.com.au\/News\/tesla-model-s-driverless.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.1215686274509804, "wgt":447880578, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023541039", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:15:33", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:15:33Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:13:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/markets\/cryptocurrency\/24\/03\/37597326\/michael-saylor-bitcoins-66k-to-16k-crash-shook-out-the-nonbelievers-as-mstr-is-up-650-in-t", "title":"Michael Saylor: Bitcoin's '$66K To $16K Crash ...

He said that MicroStrategy shares allow you to hold Bitcoin in an \"accretive\" manner, as they are using loans to continually buy more. MicroStrategy recently announced that it was selling $700 million of convertible notes to buy more tokens.\n\nAdditionally, Saylor noted that the fees charged by the ETFs, usually around 0.25%, are unattractive. While this could be a smaller point to Bitcoin maximalists, or those who simply want exposure to Bitcoin alone, Saylor noted that MicroStrategy is essentially \"giving you a yield on your shares\" through its combination of Bitcoin holdings and business operations.\n\nMicroStrategy has performed extremely well, up over 650% in the past year. However, it is important to note that Saylor is incentivized to paint MicroStrategy shares in the best way possible, as he holds over 200,000 shares, worth over $300 million.\n\nTrending: Bitcoin To $100,000? Here's what gold bug Peter Schiff said could happen on Anthony Pompliano's podcast.\n\nSaylor also compared Bitcoin to other assets, such as gold, bonds and real estate, because it is digital and \"you can trade it a million times faster than conventional assets.\" He also mentioned that it trades 24\/7, is a global currency and that it is decentralized and useful.\n\nIn addition, Saylor mentioned that the halving could be a further benefit to Bitcoin in terms of price. He says that Bitcoin has \"no negative catalysts\" because it is decentralized and doesn't have cash flows. Additionally, he mentioned that the halving could reduce the amount of selling activity, as the miners would have less BTC to sell each day. According to Saylor, the halving will reduce the amount of Bitcoin mined each day from 900 to 450.\n\nSaylor also discussed the underlying business operations of MicroStrategy. Though it is a software company, Saylor said that he is hoping to rebrand as a \"Bitcoin development company\" that uses the operating cash flows from the software business to fund more Bitcoin purchases.\n\nSaylor closed the interview by urging viewers not to think of Bitcoin as a currency, but as \"digital property; a billion-dollar building in cyberspace ... the killer application is capital preservation for everybody.\"\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nRead Next:\n\nLarge boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets -- has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,\" Trump told the hosts. \"There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.\"\n\n\"When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,\" he added. \"I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called \"the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)\" a threat to \"the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: \"I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.\"\n\n\"But,\" he went on to say, \"you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.\" Some American companies, he charged, are \"not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.\"\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls \"countries of concern,\" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,\" he wrote. \"They are a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met \"very briefly\" but that Yass \"never mentioned TikTok.\"\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they \"obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,\" which Trump has railed against.", "source":{"uri":"berkshireeagle.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"The Berkshire Eagle"}, "authors":[{"uri":"associated_press@berkshireeagle.com", "name":"Associated Press", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"jill_colvin@berkshireeagle.com", "name":"Jill Colvin", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/berkshireeagle.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/9\/d4\/9d4f448b-984e-59c9-93d6-6f994525115f\/65ef400441798.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.0117647058823529, "wgt":447880486, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285563553", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:14:05", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:14:05Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:05:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/tech\/news\/mackenzie-scott-is-worth-36-billion-and-has-revolutionized-philanthropy-since-divorcing-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos\/articleshow\/108409186.cms", "title":"MacKenzie Scott is worth $36 billion and has 'revolutionized philanthropy' since divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos", "body":"Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott finalized their divorce in 2019.J\u00f6rg Carstensen\/Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos was married to MacKenzie Scott for 25 years.\n\nScott is 39th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, worth $36 billion, and is one of the world's richest women.\n\nThe couple, who have four children together, had their divorce finalized in July 2019.

Members of Beyond the Wall Investing get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate. Learn More \"\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the largest U.S. companies in terms of stock market capitalization. However, in recent months its share price performance has raised doubts among investors whether it is still reasonable to hold the laggard:\n\nAfter looking at various sources and doing my analysis, I believe that TSLA stock has already entered a buy zone where its price can be considered reasonable for the potential business growth shareholders are set to receive over the next few years. So, I think investors should gradually start to form a long book in TSLA or hold the stock if it is already in their long-term portfolio.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to explain the sources I used for this, my first article about Tesla Inc. They are Goldman Sachs' November 2023 report, RBC's February 2024 industry research report, Barclays' comments on the fourth quarter of FY2023 results, Morgan Stanley's TSLA stock outlook for FY2024 (December 2023), and Argus Research's January 2024 report. All these sources are proprietary, which I would like to emphasize right at the beginning - this fact forces me to refer to the analyzed information in a special way, without publishing individual fragments of the reports, in order to avoid copyright infringement. Of course, I use the latest 10-K, press releases, and management comments as well as other publicly available sources. So let me start with the public information first.\n\nBased on the press release, in Q4 2023 Tesla produced ~495,000 vehicles and delivered ~484.5 thousand vehicles, which is about 12.75% and 19.5% higher than last year, respectively. The company's revenue increased by 3.49% YoY, and the gross margin - one of the main metrics all investors are keeping a close eye on - experienced a YoY slump of 613 basis points. On a QoQ basis, however, the company's GP margin only fell by 26 b.p., which can be considered a good result under the current macro conditions and against the backdrop of growing competition in the world of EVs.\n\nAccording to Barclays' report, the consensus margin for Q4 2023 was at ~17%, so Tesla's actual gross margin surpassed the market's expectations, indicating that the GP margin is past the trough now. So with progress being made in the development of the Model 2 (Tesla's next-generation vehicle) and a more concrete timeline for the start of production (expected in 2H 2025), excitement in the market could increase, the analysts add.\n\nIndeed, last quarter Tesla saw a 3.4% QoQ reduction in vehicle cost per unit, dropping to around $36,000\/unit due to volume growth (i.e., better fixed cost absorption), lower raw material costs, and potentially higher IRA benefits. But Barclays expected an ongoing ASP compression amid tough pricing conditions, with a forecasted 4% QoQ ASP reduction in 1Q FY2025. While Tesla aims to maintain pricing discipline in 2024, competition may force further price cuts. This was said at the end of January, and by mid-February Tesla reduced prices again, making Barclays' forecast come true:\n\nBut as far as I can see, this is not unique to Tesla. According to RBC's report, there's currently no evidence yet that the EV market slowdown is reaching its nadir. This is evidenced by Ford Motor Company's (F) worsening EV losses in Q4 FY2023 and its FY2024 guidance, which is worse than expected. General Motors Company (GM) reported modest BEV sales in FY2023 (though beating consensus), selling 170,000 units, with a forecast to sell 250,000 this year. For reference, compare it to Tesla's 1.8 million deliveries in FY2023 and consensus expectations of 2.1 million for FY2024. We learn even more about the quality of the currently deteriorating EV landscape from Magna International Inc. (MGA), which has moved its breakeven guidance for megatrend investments from 2025 to 2026, citing the ongoing EV slowdown as a major factor. Aptiv PLC (APTV) has also lowered its long-term gross operating margin forecast from 8-10% to 6-8%, citing the decline in the high-voltage business, a segment driven by EVs.\n\nOverall, I don't expect electric vehicle manufacturing - now TSLA's biggest revenue pot - to be the company's main focus going forward. Years of electric vehicle development and the rapid growth of the financials of the pioneers have attracted so many firms and start-ups wanting a piece of the pie that the overall EV market going to get oversupplied very soon (if not already), according to a study by Redburn Atlantic (proprietary source):\n\nElon Musk is, as far as I can tell, a mission-driven person. If many years ago, when he was just starting to build Tesla, he wanted to solve the environmental problems associated with the proliferation of ICE vehicles, then in the current conditions of oversupply that goal seems almost achieved. Next, he's likely to shift focus to AI, full self-drive (\"FSD\"), robots, clean energy markets, and improving existing EV software.\n\nTesla needs a business model change, and I agree with Nick Colas, who said in a recent interview with CNBC that TSLA should consider a $10 billion to $15 billion capital raise to drive its transformation from an automaker to a disruptive technology company. I do not presume to judge the appropriateness of this figure, but according to Nick this should be sufficient, and for a company as large as TSLA such a capital increase is more than possible.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla does not have to give up on defending its current market leadership in the EV market when such a transition is imminent. The company has to seek to develop infrastructure, services, and related products and constantly expand its offerings. One of the company's projects - the Supercharger Network - is expected to become a major revenue driver in the coming years as many automakers, including Ford, GM, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have agreed to adopt the Supercharger charging standard (NACS) in their electric vehicles by early 2024-2025, according to analysts at Argus Research. This will allow owners of these vehicles to use Tesla's Superchargers, which are the largest fast-charging network in the world with 5,952 stations at the end of Q4 2023.\n\nSo even though the recently reported slower growth in both vehicle deliveries and EPS creates an overhang on the stock in the short term, I believe that Tesla is well positioned for longer-term growth given its leading position in the EV, cleaner energy markets; the tailwinds from other projects like robots add some upside to this story.\n\nTalking about the company's valuation today, Tesla's PEG ratio for next year of 2.89x may seem very high to many - especially compared to the sector median of 1.55x. And in general, we see no signs of undervaluation in the overall picture of Tesla's valuation multiples:\n\nBut let's look at this picture from a slightly different angle. What if we were to look at TSLA as a full-fledged technology company and not just a car company? Then, given its size, we have to compare it to other \"Magnificent 7\" companies. What do we see? Tesla stock appears to be extremely overvalued on a price-to-earnings ratio basis:\n\nHowever, if we use the long-term growth potential of the companies as a comparison and then also compare it with the implied P\/E ratios, we now see that TSLA is becoming one of the most undervalued stocks in the peer group:\n\nIn other words, this graph can be described as follows: If an investor chooses between buying TSLA and other mega-caps, buying Tesla stock today will give him\/her the highest earnings per share growth rate at a roughly average implied P\/E ratio.\n\nOf course, there is a high risk that the market's current view of EPS will change dramatically in 5-6 years. Therefore, the current growth rate may be a bit too high. But if my assumption about the rapid repositioning of the company from a pure car company to a full-fledged tech giant over the next few years comes true, then by the logic of things we will see a slower contraction of the multiple. This means Tesla is likely to maintain its high multiples for longer than currently expected - which bodes well for good total returns over the next few years.\n\nSpeaking of concrete figures: If we assume that Tesla's P\/E ratio is in the 25-30x range by FY2030, then at the current consensus earnings figure of $10.92 per share, the stock should get to the mid-range of ~$300. That equates to a total return of about 71.3%, giving a CAGR of 10.48% over the next 6 years.\n\nWhile I remain optimistic about Tesla's growth prospects, some risks should be carefully weighed before you make any investment decision.\n\nFirst, the ongoing slowdown in the electric vehicle market combined with intensifying competition is challenging Tesla's dominance and market share. So pricing and margin pressures exacerbate these concerns and may impact profitability given competitive pricing dynamics.\n\nSecond, the transition to a disruptive technology company poses risks as Tesla will need to make operational adjustments and investments to expand its offering - this is where the execution risks come in. Also, the absolute valuation metrics raise eyebrows about potential overvaluation as the macroeconomic factors add complexity to Tesla's growth trajectory, killing the valuation premium (i.e., the multiple keeps shrinking faster, which is not good for the stock price).\n\nThis is why every existing or potential investor must keep a close eye on industry trends and the dynamics of the competitive landscape. Tesla's gross margin over the next few quarters must show that it has bottomed out and is ready to stabilize and eventually rise. It's also important to look at the non-EV segments and their health - from what we've seen in Q4 2023, everything is going well so far. But whether this trend will continue in the future is a big question.\n\nWhen you buy a stock like Tesla, you're buying a ticket to the future, so to speak. It's very important that this ticket does not expire. From what I see today, Tesla's \"ticket\" is still valid: the company continues to develop in different directions and is actively trying to ride several waves at once. I don't think multitasking will hurt the company in the long run; on the contrary, it's a great way to expand and diversify the business structure and gain a foothold in new, promising end markets. The most important thing in this case is to have a visionary at the helm who has the ability to take on several tasks at once. Elon Musk's entire biography shows us that this is just one of those cases.\n\nI see today's difficulties in TSLA price action as an excellent opportunity to take a long-term position, which may have to be averaged down, but which I calculate should yield more than 10% annually by 2030 even at today's prices.\n\nI'm therefore rating the stock a \"Buy\" for the first time today.", "source":{"uri":"seekingalpha.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Seeking Alpha"}, "authors":[{"uri":"oakoff_investments@seekingalpha.com", "name":"Oakoff Investments", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.gettyimages.com\/id\/1768680938\/ru\/%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE\/bletchley-england-spacex-x-and-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-speaks-with-members-of-the-media-during-day.jpg?b=1&s=594x594&w=0&k=20&c=Q1JRT_4FY07qgORzvZdBN8nOpCVa40T8dHjxXDz3aAo=", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.2, "wgt":447880330, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023538996", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"19:11:35", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T19:11:35Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T19:11:13Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/elon-musk-once-stated-nobody-190012187.html", "title":"Elon Musk Once Stated, 'Nobody Ever Changed The World On 40 hours A Week'  --  But Now The Average Employee Works 44 Hours Per Week Just To Make Ends Meet", "body":"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, is notorious for his exceptional work ethic, often working long hours with minimal sleep.\n\nMusk believes that changing the world necessitates an extraordinary commitment beyond the conventional 40-hour workweek. In promoting his companies on social media in 2018, Musk stated on X, \"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.\" Ironically, a few years later, average employees find themselves working more than 40 hours.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMusk's hardcore work ethic has sparked considerable debate and criticism over the years. During Tesla Model 3's production peak, Musk's commitment saw him working 120-hour weeks, missing personal milestones and resorting to insomnia medication to manage sleeplessness. His method of dividing the day into five-minute increments illustrates an intense drive to optimize every moment for productivity, a trait admired by some but seen as unsustainable by others.\n\nThe tech industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, has long celebrated this intense work culture, often blurring the lines between work and personal life. Engineers and entrepreneurs are known to forgo traditional meals for efficiency, embodying a lifestyle where work predominates every aspect of life. Such dedication has led to innovations but also raised questions about the sustainability of such a lifestyle.\n\nMusk's attempt to apply the same hardcore work philosophy at X, demanding employees to commit or resign, resulted in a significant staff departure, indicating a potential misalignment between his work ethic and workforce expectations.\n\nContrary to Musk's belief that long hours are essential to achieving success, research and historical evidence suggest that longer hours don't necessarily equate to higher productivity or better job performance. Studies have found that increased work intensity and prolonged hours can impair work quality, lead to decreased alertness and reduce overall workplace productivity.\n\nTrending: Around 56% Of Americans Feel Behind On Saving For Retirement - How much does somebody need to stay on track?\n\nA recent Slack survey of over 10,300 employees globally found that pressuring employees to work after hours leads to lower productivity, more work-related stress and decreased job satisfaction. Those who chose to work extra hours of their own accord reported slightly higher productivity and wellness scores, highlighting the importance of autonomy and employee choice in work hours.\n\nThe assumption that world-changing work requires excessively long hours is also challenged by the historical example of Henry Ford, who found that reducing the workweek improved productivity in his automobile factories. This finding supports the notion that shorter work hours can enhance efficiency and output, a counterintuitive result in a culture that often celebrates the burn-the-midnight-oil mentality.\n\nDespite the negative impact, more Americans are working 40-plus hours out of necessity. According to a 2021 Gallup survey, the average full-time employee works about 44 hours per week, with roughly 41% working 45 or more hours. This statistic highlights a trend where many work beyond the traditional 40-hour workweek not just to change the world but to make ends meet.\n\nForbes reported that the U.S. is the most overworked country in the developed world. American workers log more hours annually compared to their counterparts in several developed countries, such as Germany. The average work year in the U.S. encompasses about 1,750 hours, which is 400 hours more than what German employees work annually.\n\nFor those feeling the strain of overwork, managing your finances differently could be a key to relief. Consulting a financial advisor could open up strategies for making your money work harder for you, potentially easing the need for long hours. Advisers can explore avenues for savings, investments and retirement planning, aiming to secure a future where working past retirement age isn't a necessity. It's a step toward not just enduring work but ensuring work and savings pave the way to a more balanced life.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Elon Musk Once Stated, 'Nobody Ever Changed The World On 40 hours A Week' -- But Now The Average Employee Works 44 Hours Per Week Just To Make Ends Meet originally appeared on Benzinga.com", "source":{"uri":"finance.yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo!

In return, OpenAI said that Musk wanted to combine the company with Tesla and become its CEO in old emails. Now, let's hop on to the recent development.\n\nElon Musk shared this update via a post on X, however, he didn't delve into many details. According to him, the Grok chatbot could open source this week. At the same time, he fired shots at OpenAI. \"OpenAI is a lie,\" he replied to a user. Open sourcing the code of Grok means that developers could access and modify the code which could open doors for creativity. Among many who reacted to this post is Nothing CEO Carl Pei who called this move, \"Based\" and Perplexity boss Aravind Srinivas who reacted with a salute emoji.\n\nGrok is accessible exclusively for those users who have subscribed to Premium+ on X. Musk, once referred to Grok as \"based and loves sarcasm.\" He reiterated that Grok has \"little humor in its responses.\"\n\nMusk's companies have a history of open-sourcing codes for users. Tesla, for example, made its patents public ten years ago, and now many car makers use its electric vehicle charging connector.

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,\" Trump told the hosts. \"There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.

That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called \"the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)\" a threat to \"the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: \"I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.\"\n\n\"But,\" he went on to say, \"you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.\" Some American companies, he charged, are \"not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.\"\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls \"countries of concern,\" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,\" he wrote. \"They are a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met \"very briefly\" but that Yass \"never mentioned TikTok.\"\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they \"obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,\" which Trump has railed against.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Facilities in California and Texas were used for animal testing on monkeys, along with other animals, to progress Neuralink's technology. The issues documented by FDA include findings from the California facility, noting that no such issues were seen at its Texas facility.\n\nFDA reportedly visited the facility last year from June 12 to 22 - representing the agency's sole inspections of the company's facilities on record. Inspectors identified a litany of problems at the site, including missing calibration records for instruments such as a pH meter used in one of the studies and, for another study, seven instruments including a vital signs monitor which had no record of having been calibrated. Additional issues at the facility included quality assurance officials not signing off on the final study report or documenting any deviations from approval protocols or standard operating procedures.\n\nCurrently, FDA has not issued a designation detailing the severity of problems found at the inspection, according to the agency database. Reuters, who first broke the news of the report, wrote that according to experts, \"While the problems identified are serious, they do not appear to be significant enough to justify the FDA's worst inspection designation, which would prompt action.\"\n\nThe agency routinely conducts inspections after human trial approval and before commercial approval to \"assure data integrity and reliability\", along with compliance with accompanying FDA regulations, Carly Pflaum, an FDA spokesperson, told Reuters.\n\nNeuralink, which obtained FDA approval in May 2023 to start human trials for its implantable, cited its animal research data in the application to the agency. Just last month, the company reported that its first human patient had been implanted with the brain chip and appears to have fully recovered. The patient, according to Elon Musk, CEO of Neuralink, in a Spaces event on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, is able to control a computer mouse using their thoughts.\n\nExperts have questioned why FDA had not inspected Neuralink before giving approval for its in-human trails since concerns about its animal subjects have been reported since 2022. The agency has jurisdiction to conduct such an inspection before permitting a company to begin its clinical trial and has done so before in other cases.\n\nVictor Krauthamer, a former long-time FDA official, told Reuters, \"It would have made sense for the FDA to have conducted the inspection before human trial approval. These are violations of fundamental requirements that you don't want to worry about happening again in the human trial.\"\n\nPrevious allegations\n\nThis, however, isn't the first time Neuralink has been on the wrong side of animal-welfare violation allegations. MD+DI reported in December 2023 that the company was being accused of animal suffering and death during its research into the brain implant. An exclusive Reuters report revealed multiple internal staff complaints that animal testing was being rushed, resulting in needless suffering and death of its testing animals.\n\n\"Some complaints stated that Elon Musk, the CEO of Neuralink, was pressuring employees to accelerate development despite resulting botched experiments,\" according to previous MD+DI reporting. \"These failed tests would have had to be repeated, 20 current and former employees told Reuters, increasing the testing and subsequent killing of more animals.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group, filed a complaint with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in early 2022, alleging that the company was mistreating its animal subjects and causing unnecessary animal deaths. Neuralink denied these allegations.\n\nThe USDA did, however, opt to open a probe into Neuralink's treatment of animals at the end of 2022.\n\nIn an email to MD+DI at the time, USDA Office of the Inspector General wrote, \"USDA OIG neither confirms nor denies the existence of any such investigation. We have no comment.\"\n\nIn summer 2023, an update from Secretary Thomas Vilsack in a letter to Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer stated that the agency had not found violations at the facilities apart from a company reported incident in 2019. It was further noted that more inspections were planned.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nThe FDA report detailing the problems at Neuralink's California facility has sparked renewed concern over company transparency.\n\nIn an article by Forbes, industry experts raised questions about Neuralink's blas\u00e9 approach to communicating scientific news, and the ethicality of not registering its implant trial on ClinicalTrials.gov -- a public database in which most clinical trials are registered for transparency and accountability.\n\nNeuralink's dissemination of important information usually comes from social media posts on Musk's X platform rather than traditional peer reviewed publications, or repositories, which Marcello Ienca, a professor of ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich, told Forbes, \"Seems to sidestep the established protocols that underpin scientific integrity,\" and prevents experts from evaluating the full scope and impact of claimed advances.\n\nAdditionally, while not illegal for the company to not have registered its clinical trial on ClinicalTrial.gov, Ienca said not doing so \"violates fundamental ethical guidelines for biomedical research.\" Specifically, she cited the Declaration of Helsinki, a cornerstone statement of ethical principles for medial research involving humans. Neuralink has not communicated to the public that it has set up any internal ethics board or code of ethics and has not engaged in any major activities from policy organizations like OECD, according to Forbes.", "source":{"uri":"mddionline.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"MDDI Online"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/eu-images.contentstack.com\/v3\/assets\/blt14ac89070d5e4751\/bltd98070d43f2ee295\/65ef52e2f2e490040a7619a4\/FDA_Breakthrough_Device_Designation_(43).png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.1450980392156863, "wgt":447879759, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023524122", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:59:41", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:59:41Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:59:19Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6666666865348816, "url":"https:\/\/uk.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/donald-trump-says-many-of-his-sneakers-were-bought-with-bitcoin-3376266", "title":"Donald Trump Says 'Many' Of His Sneakers Were Bought With Bitcoin By Benzinga", "body":"Benzinga - A couple of weeks ago, former President Donald Trump unveiled a collection of 1,000 Trump sneakers at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia. The shoes, which sold out quickly for $399 per pair, could be bought with Bitcoin.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the shoes in an interview on CNBC: \"Sometimes we'll let people pay through Bitcoin ... it's an additional form of currency\".\n\nThis statement was huge coming from the former president, who has said that Bitcoin is a disaster waiting to happen in 2021. His stance has changed since then. According to Trump, \"Bitcoin has taken on a life of its own\" and he \"can live with it one way or the other.\"\n\nTrump seems to be going even further by letting people buy his shoes with Bitcoin. The action accepts that Bitcoin is \"an additional form of currency,\" a huge change from his past stance on crypto.\n\nTrump has been in conversations with former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is pro-crypto and has endorsed Trump. The conversations were centered around the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which Ramswamy is against. He pointed out the potential harm it could cause Trump. In turn, Trump promised to \"never allow\" CBDCs, showing that he values Ramaswamy's opinion on crypto.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also discusses crypto projects he is involved in, saying that he \"does little things for fun\" and \"make[s] money with it.\" While this does not mean that he directly bought Bitcoin, it is likely a reference to the Trump Digital Trading Cards non-fungible token (NFT) project. Trump collected trading royalties on the project, amassing a stash of over 1,400 ETH. Trump sold 1,075 of those tokens for $2.4 million.\n\nTrending: If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here's how much you'd have today.\n\nThough Trump was not directly involved in the NFT project, he was directly involved with the shoes, which seemed to garner a lot more attention. According to Trump, the last pair of shoes, which were a special edition, sold for $450,000. \"People were going crazy for these sneakers. You probably were, too. Everybody was,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also added that \"so many [of the sneakers] were paid for with the ... cryptocurrency.\" Bitcoin was created to be a store of value and a form of payment. However, it has struggled to get mainstream adoption in terms of transactional use. The former president offering the ability to pay using Bitcoin could open the floodgates in this regard.\n\nHowever, Trump also noted that he \"would not allow countries to go off the dollar, because when we lose that standard, that will be like losing a revolutionary war.\" Trump may be OK with Bitcoin but don't expect it to overtake the U.S. dollar if Trump wins the presidential election in November.\n\nBitcoin breached the $72,000 level and set new all-time highs on the morning of the interview, up nearly 5% on the day.", "source":{"uri":"uk.investing.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Investing.com UK"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/i-invdn-com.investing.com\/news\/LYNXMPEE0A01Z_L.jpg", "eventUri":"eng-9384516", "sentiment":0.05882352941176472, "wgt":447879581, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285546943", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:56:42", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:56:42Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:55:13Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8509804010391235, "url":"https:\/\/www.europesun.com\/news\/274153352\/musk-comments-on-us-attempt-to-weaken-russia", "title":"Musk comments on US attempt to weaken Russia", "body":"The Tesla CEO replied to tech investor David Sacks, who believes Washington's policies have actually made Moscow stronger\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has agreed with investor David Sacks' view that Washington's attempts to weaken Russia have \"come true in reverse\" and in reality only made it stronger.\n\nSharing his opinion on the Ukraine conflict in an interview posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, Sacks called it \"Biden's big backfire.\"\n\n\"We've made the Russian military stronger, it's larger than it was before, it produces far more weapons, the industrial base is ramped up.

Meanwhile, it's the US that has seen its stockpiles \"depleted and hollowed out,\" he argued.\n\nThe economic sanctions on Russia have become another major miscalculation of Biden's policies, according to Sacks. He believes that the idea to \"crush\" Russia with sanctions was delusional as the country's economy stabilized and even outperformed G7 economies in 2023.\n\n\"The Russian economy is growing faster than any of the G7 economies. It's really booming and it's our European allies' economies that have been crushed by the sanctions,\" he noted.\n\nBut it is Ukraine that has been suffering the most from US involvement in the conflict, he argued. He attacked Biden who claimed that the US would \"help ease the suffering of the Ukrainians\" but in fact, Washington's support \"of this proxy war and our willingness to fight to the last Ukrainian\" has led to a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the two men have been in alignment on such issues. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with Sacks' statement on X that NATO \"faced an existential crisis\" after the collapse of the Soviet Union and decided to embark on an expansion spree to fill the void.\n\nThe US has been Ukraine's primary backer and has provided over $111 billion in military and financial assistance. However, in recent months, US aid has subsided drastically as the administration of President Joe Biden has struggled to overcome Republican resistance to its efforts to push through another $60 billion for Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has said that the US and its allies who continue to arm Ukraine cannot prevent Russia from achieving its goals and are only prolonging the suffering of Ukrainians.", "source":{"uri":"europesun.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"europesun.com"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/cdn.bignewsnetwork.com\/MGY3NzUzYWMtYzR.jpg", "eventUri":"eng-9385267", "sentiment":0.05882352941176472, "wgt":447879402, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285546131", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:55:58", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:55:58Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:51:07Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/morgan-stanley-was-counting-on-150-million-in-twitter-deal-fees", "title":"Morgan Stanley Was Counting on $150 Million in Twitter Deal Fees", "body":"When Morgan Stanley first worked on Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter acquisition in April 2022, bankers estimated fees on the deal could reach $150 million or more, according to two people who saw the terms.

What has President Biden been doing in the unusual amount of time he spends without anything on his schedule? By his own words, we know he is counting the number of potato chips and other snack foods in a bag -- and by golly, he has promised to stop this product shrinkage and punish the greedy food companies.\n\nA small potato chip company operating with a modest margin finds that, due to general inflation, costs have risen sharply for potatoes, vegetable oil, rent, machinery, labor, etc. Facing this problem, the company can either raise prices or reduce the amount of product in a bag and continue to sell it at the old price. Businesses learned there is often less consumer resistance to a reduction in portion size than a price increase -- so fewer chips per bag. But in the end, it is the same thing -- the consumer is paying more per chip. The president calls this \"shrinkflation.\" He should know; he caused it.\n\nMr. Biden often acts as if inflation came from the tooth fairy (or \"greedy businessmen\") rather than as a result of the actions and policies of his own government. Among Mr. Biden's many misstatements (in perhaps the worst State of the Union address ever) was his claim that U.S. inflation is \"the lowest in the world.\" In fact, China, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and the whole euro area, among other jurisdictions, have lower inflation rates.\n\nPoliticians have complained about high prescription drug prices for decades, noting that many pills cost relatively little to produce. What they are choosing to ignore or don't understand is the difference between average and marginal cost.\n\nThe research and development costs for many drugs run into tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Most drugs have limited markets in that not many people have the specific disease or conditions that the drug treats. The marginal production cost of a drug may be only $5 per pill, but the average cost (to cover research and development and Food and Drug Administration approval) per pill may be $700, causing consumers and politicians to scream about high drug prices.\n\nMr. Biden and many other politicians are demanding price controls -- which have failed virtually every time they have been tried. No rational pharmaceutical company will spend huge amounts of money developing new, lifesaving drugs if it cannot recoup full development costs. This is basic economics that the political class chooses to ignore -- but those who die because of the lack of new drugs no longer vote.\n\nThe president proposed many new spending programs and subsidies for favored constituencies. Almost all politicians do this to a greater or lesser extent while ignoring how to pay for it. Most governments are well above optimum size -- meaning that at some point, almost all spending programs no longer meet a cost-benefit test (many of them never did). And many cost-benefit studies ignore the acquisition costs of obtaining the funds.\n\nMr. Biden claimed that the \"rich and corporations\" will pay his spending programs. Politicians have been making this claim since at least the introduction of the income tax in 1913 -- and of course, it never happens. Mr. Biden and the other big taxers keep up the refrain about wanting the rich to \"pay their fair share\" while refusing to address the basic question of what a fair number is.\n\nOne of the problems with trying to tax the rich is that they and their capital can move. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently stated that her tax base had moved to Palm Beach. Surprise, surprise -- people move from higher to lower tax jurisdictions, which happens between U.S. states and countries.\n\nMany studies are showing that the high marginal tax rates do not bring any added income to governments (people have legal and illegal ways of moving income and wealth). High tax rates, however, discourage capital investment, job creation and economic growth. Billionaire Ken Griffin and his Citadel Fund recently moved to Florida from Illinois. Already, he has made many large investments in Florida, along with huge donations to various Florida charities. The amount of benefit from businesses Mr. Griffin, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and the other super-rich create and charities they support in their chosen locales is many times the direct tax that any government could expect to get from them.\n\nMr. Biden has been saying for more than four years that no one making less than $400,000 a year under his proposal will pay one penny more in taxes -- but after inflation, $400,000 is already down to about $350,000 in purchasing power. In an inflationary environment, such promises don't mean much.\n\nMr. Biden's home state of Delaware has favorable tax and regulatory rules for corporations, greatly benefiting the state -- which Mr. Biden has defended and bragged about. Pension funds own a large percentage of many American corporations whose profits fund retiree pensions. Higher taxes on corporations mean lower wages, higher prices and smaller pensions.\n\nAll too many in the political class, including Mr. Biden, prefer to exploit economic ignorance rather than to teach and practice sound economic policy.

In a video that was uploaded on Friday, Nelson shot the electric pickup truck with a series of guns, including an AR-15 and .50-caliber rifle.\n\n\"Nothing is actually bulletproof. There's always going to be a bigger bullet, but today we are going to see scientifically where that line gets drawn,\" Nelson said in the video.\n\nThe Cybertruck was able to survive shots from a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber rifle which left small dents in the metal. However, Nelson noted the truck's metal cracked if the shots landed too close together on the metal.\n\nThe truck took on more damage, however, when Nelson brought in some faster weapons, including a .17-caliber rifle, as well as an AR-15 and .50-caliber gun. The video from the .50-caliber gun shows the shot flying through the car door -- which Nelson left open to avoid damaging the truck's interior -- and taking a nickel-sized chunk out of the metal. The metal also cracked all the way through when Nelson fired the .223-caliber AR-15 at the vehicle.\n\nWhile the truck didn't prove entirely bulletproof, Nelson said he was still impressed by its durability.\n\n\"The truck is still in one piece,\" Nelson said in the video. \"There's a few ventilation holes now, but, overall, I am very satisfied with how bullet -resistant the Cybertruck is. It works on 9 millimeter, .22. Anything faster than that and there's gonna be a hole, but still slowing down a bullet is infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle.\"\n\nNotably, a .50-caliber rifle is an incredibly high-powered weapon. A single round from a .50-caliber Browning Machine Gun could \"knock down hovering helicopters, penetrate armored limousines,\" according to The Small Arms Review.\n\nAn auto expert previously told InsideEVs, that the Cybertruck will likely be able to deflect weapons that have a lower velocity like a pistol or a Tommy Gun, but it won't be able to withstand faster weapons, like a .223 AR-15. -- which can fire bullets at a speed of around 3,000 feet per second, more than three times as fast as a Tommy Gun. (During the vehicle's delivery event in November, Tesla also shared a video of the truck surviving a round of bullets from a .45-caliber Tommy Gun.)\n\nNelson and a spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the Cybertruck was first announced in 2019, Musk has hyped up the rugged nature of the truck, claiming the vehicle would be entirely bulletproof.\n\nWhen Musk first revealed the Cybertruck in 2019 he attempted to demonstrate the vehicle's \"armor glass\" windows by having Tesla's design boss throw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window. At the time, the glass immediately broke on contact with the metal ball. Musk later said on social media that a prior test had compromised the window.\n\n\"Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan in 2023, Musk said that the standard Cybertruck wouldn't have bulletproof glass, but the stainless steel doors would still be thick enough to stop a bullet. Musk said Tesla would also offer a version of the truck with thicker fixed-pane glass windows.", "source":{"uri":"yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ny\/api\/res\/1.2\/7UzYYuz_4Cw9jfSIzW8xFA--\/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/business_insider_articles_888\/18ca1f7f3973f17e97aa5944ea537ab9", "eventUri":"eng-9385104", "sentiment":-0.207843137254902, "wgt":447879033, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023511170", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:49:25", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:49:25Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:48:53Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7686274647712708, "url":"https:\/\/news.abplive.com\/technology\/top-tech-news-today-march-11-urban-harmonic-series-of-soundbars-launched-dot-and-ericsson-to-skill-students-for-100-5g-use-case-labs-1671232", "title":"Top Tech News Today: Harmonic Series Of Soundbars Launched, DoT And Ericsson To Skill Students For 100 5G Use Case Labs, More", "body":"Urban Harmonic 2240 features Dolby Surround Sound.

I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.\"\n\nThe call happened before markets opened Monday morning, and subsequently, Meta shares fell 4%, and at one point were trading down 5%.\n\nAs for TikTok, Trump said \"there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad\" on the platform. \"There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.

A House committee advanced legislation last week that would similarly force TikTok to cut ties with ByteDance.\n\nIn a powerful display of bipartisanship -- rare these days in Washington -- the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party used nearly identical language to describe the risks of TikTok.\n\nThe Republican chair, Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, said that \"America's foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States.\" And his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, said TikTok \"poses critical threats to our national security\" as long as it is owned by ByteDance.\n\nBut as the bill was under consideration, Trump said last week on Truth Social, his social media platform, that \"if you get rid of TikTok,\" it would double Facebook's business. He said he did not want Facebook \"doing better.\" Trump was banned from Facebook the day after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, and reinstated early last year.\n\nThe full House is expected to vote on the legislation Wednesday. President Joe Biden said last week that he would sign the measure into law if it reached his desk.\n\nTo support his \"enemy of the people\" claim, Trump singled out grants that Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, made in 2020 to state and local election offices to help their administration of voting during the pandemic. Trump suggested that Zuckerberg, whose website was part of the Trump 2016 campaign's strategy for victory, should face prison time for those donations.\n\nTrump also claimed that Facebook was every bit as beholden to China as TikTok. Facebook is blocked in the country and attempts by its parent company, Meta, for a return have been unsuccessful. The company has taken steps to sell its virtual reality headsets there.\n\nThe CNBC interviewer asked Trump about suspicions that he had been \"paid off\" to change his view on TikTok after a meeting with a major TikTok investor, billionaire Jeff Yass.\n\nTrump and his team are working frenetically to find new major donors as he heads into a general election against Biden, who, along with allied groups, has much more money behind him.\n\nTrump met this month with the world's second-richest man, Elon Musk, and at a recent event hosted by the conservative group the Club for Growth, Trump reportedly praised Yass as \"fantastic.\" The Club for Growth recently had a rapprochement with Trump after many months of a freeze.\n\nYass, who has previously been a harsh critic of Trump's, appears to have had his own change of heart. An official at a pro-Trump super political action committee declined to say whether Yass had donated money to the outside group, but a person close to the campaign said the Trump team expected a significant donation from Yass to one of the outside groups backing the former president.\n\nYass has funded a major advocacy drive in Washington to stop the banning of TikTok. He and his allies have recruited several former Trump administration officials to help with the effort -- including Tony Sayegh, who was a Treasury official, and Kellyanne Conway, who was a senior counselor to the president.\n\nIn the CNBC interview, Trump denied discussing TikTok with Yass at their meeting.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" Trump said, saying it had been a brief meeting with Yass and his wife. \"He never mentioned TikTok.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of the new legislation is striking because of his move to restrict the company while in office. An executive order he signed in August 2020 said that TikTok's data collection from its users \"threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.\" It added that TikTok could be used to spread disinformation that benefited Beijing.\n\n\"These risks are real,\" the executive order said.\n\nTrump's administration moved to block Apple's and Google's app stores from carrying TikTok over concerns about the app's Chinese ownership. But federal courts ruled repeatedly to block Trump's TikTok ban from taking effect.\n\nByteDance seemed to reach a deal to sell a stake in TikTok to Oracle, a cloud computing company whose executives had ties to Trump. The acquisition never came to fruition as the legal challenges to Trump's ban made their way through the courts.\n\nTrump acknowledged in his CNBC interview that well-paid lobbyists were shaping how the government handles TikTok.\n\nCongress, Trump said, is \"extremely subject to people called lobbyists, who happen to be very talented, very good and very rich.\"\n\n\"I could have banned TikTok,\" he added, \"I had it banned just about, I could have gotten it done.

Co-founded by LGBTQ+ activist Eric Cervini; his partner, Adam Powell, a noted drag performer; and celebrity cross-dresser RuPaul, Allstora was created to be an \"independent bookstore committed to sharing all stories and sharing profits fairly.\"\n\nNot only did Cervini, Powell, and RuPaul initially insist on giving authors a higher share of the profits from their books, but they also took a hard stance against censorship. \"At Allstora, we believe that the censorship of any book, perspective, or story is incompatible with the survival of democracy,\" its website said as recently as March 6. \"We cannot fight the ideologies of hate if we lack the ability to study, understand, and react to them.\"\n\nThat \"decision to carry all books\" angered many leftists, especially those who identify somewhere along the LGBTQ+ spectrum. LGBTQ Nation railed that Allstora dared to carry books written by \"anti-LGBTQ+ extremists,\" such as the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh; Chaya Raichik, better known on social media as Libs of TikTok, whom LGBTQ Nation called a \"hate monger\"; and Abigail Shrier, described as \"transphobic.\" Others objected to Allstora selling books by former President Donald Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nAllstora tried to quell their concerns by flagging certain titles that \"are contrary to our core values.\" The store even promised to donate all proceeds from sales of those titles \"to fight book bans.\"\n\nBut the leftist onslaught continued unabated, and Allstora folded to pressure within days. On March 9, Cervini released a full-page statement that chronicled his rapid transition from anti-censorship advocate to mob apologist.\n\n\"We envisioned a bookstore that split its profits with all authors: not just queer and trans storytellers, but also Black, Brown, disabled, neurodiverse, everyone,\" Cervini wrote. \"A place where all the infinite intersections of humanity could find their books, their people.\"\n\n\"As a historian, I understood that even the most hateful of books can have educational value,\" he continued. \"I knew that to dismantle prejudice, we must examine its illogic.

Answers are based on interviews with experts including Yoshino and Schwartz, as well as articles written by law firms Duane Morris and Perkins Coie.\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court in June doesn't have a direct bearing on employer policy -- but it says a lot about where the court may go next. That's because rules governing discrimination in university admissions and in employment come from different parts of the same laws: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nCompanies have been allowed to recognize race as part of their employment selection criteria under rules governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (these are codified as part of Title VII in the Civil Rights Act). And the EEOC said that the court's June decision \"does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background.\"\n\nStill, two weeks after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion, 13 state Republican Attorney Generals wrote to CEOs of the 100 largest U.S. companies, warning them that DEI policies could violate laws on racial discrimination.\n\nThe letter confirms that the Supreme Court's decision could accelerate challenges to a corporation's DEI efforts and that employers need to carefully evaluate whether their policies could face the threat of litigation, according to Gibson Dunn.\n\nExperts believe the court's views on race-conscious admissions will ultimately carry over in some fashion to corporate employment policies, and have been advising their clients to bring their DEI programs in line.\n\nYoshino says there are three criteria that can make a DEI program risky: 1) a preference for certain individuals over others; 2) when this preference is bestowed on a legally protected group: people of a certain race, color, religion, national origin or sex; and 3) when a policy relates to a palpable benefit like a job, pay rise or development opportunity.\n\nThough the exact boundaries may still be unclear, outreach efforts aimed at convincing more people of color to apply to positions aren't likely to raise red flags, but fellowship programs open only to minority candidates might. Similarly, calibrating compensation around diversity within a specific team could raise alarm bells while vaguer, company-wide goals might not.\n\nSo if a company policy says a manager will get more of a bonus because they have a racially diverse team, or if a fellowship exhibits a preference for a protected group such as people of color, then it is legally perilous, according to Yoshino.\n\nIf a company has unconscious bias training for everybody at the firm, then that's legally safe because it's not directed at a particular group and everybody goes through it, he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court may add a new wrinkle to laws around employment discrimination in June. It heard arguments late last year in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, a case in which a female police sergeant alleged that she was reassigned to a less prestigious role because she is a woman.\n\nThe City argued that the transfer couldn't constitute a violation of the Title VII anti-discrimination law because it wasn't significantly harmful to her as it didn't result in a change in her pay or title. The sergeant argued that the treatment was still damaging and unlawful because it was based on her gender. The justices seemed receptive to the sergeant's arguments.\n\nThe court may confine its judgment only to job transfers. But external lawyers say a wider decision could put companies at risk of an array of reverse discrimination suits for things that aren't currently deemed palpable benefits. For example, companies that offer mentoring or coaching opportunities only to members of a certain protected class might be at legal risk from someone who argues that not being included is damaging to them. A very broad ruling could discourage employers from offering any development or retention programs specifically for women or people of color.\n\n\"As a practical matter,\" wrote lawyers for Duane Morris, companies should identify every program that makes such distinctions and \"either eliminate the exclusions or modify them so that they are not based on gender, race or other protected characteristics.\"", "source":{"uri":"whittierdailynews.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Whittier Daily News"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.whittierdailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/US-NEWS-DEI-LAWYERS-GET.jpg?w=640", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.1294117647058823, "wgt":447878340, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023498214", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:38:47", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:38:47Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:38:15Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2024\/03\/11\/business-is-booming-for-dei-lawyers-as-corporate-america-asks-whats-legal\/", "title":"Business is booming for DEI lawyers as corporate America asks 'what's legal?'", "body":"The furor over corporate diversity, equity and inclusion programs has turned so explosive that it's never been busier for specialists on the topic.\n\nSome companies are cutting back on DEI initiatives while others are disbanding them altogether.

The justices seemed receptive to the sergeant's arguments.\n\nThe court may confine its judgment only to job transfers. But external lawyers say a wider decision could put companies at risk of an array of reverse discrimination suits for things that aren't currently deemed palpable benefits.

The new startup media brand has fired all Deadspin staffers, in addition.\n\nG\/O Media CEO Jim Spanfeller informed employees of the decision via the following email:\n\nThe remains of Deadspin, as in its latest interaction, will be best remembered for a story in November in which author Carron J. Phillips willfully lied about a nine-year-old Chiefs fan wearing blackface.\n\nPhillips used a deceptive photo that showed only the side of the child's face painted black; not the entire photo showing the kid painted the other side of his face red in support of the Chiefs.\n\nThe author also stated that the boy \"hates black people and Native Americans.\"\n\nDeadspin and Phillips doubled down on the smear, even after they had clearly lied. Not until 11 days later, when the family of the fan threatened legal action, did Deadspin correct the story.\n\nIn February, the family filed a lawsuit against parent company G\/O Media alleging author Carron J. Phillips \"maliciously and wantonly\" attacked their son as part of a \"race-drenched political agenda\" to \"generate clicks.\"\n\nWe spoke to a legal analyst about the lawsuit last month about how Deadspin \"cannot claim ignorance\" and is likely liable.\n\nPer Lexie Rigden, an attorney and frequent legal analyst for Fox News (check out her viral new column on the Kelce brothers):\n\n\"Although defamation laws vary state by state, in general, to prove defamation, a plaintiff would have to show that a false statement was made (i.e. that this child is wearing blackface); that the statement was published to third parties (easy--it's all over the internet, with even Elon Musk commenting); that the defendant knew it was false or was at least was negligent in publishing it (Phillips and Deadspin saw the full photo and knew the context in which it was taken); and damages, that some harm was caused to the plaintiff's reputation (the death threats cited in the lawsuit).\"\n\nThird parties re-published the false statement. Check.\n\nDeadspin and Phillips knew they printed a false statement. Check.\n\nThe kid and his parents endure damages by way of threats and harassment. Check.\n\nTranslation: defamation.\n\nZombie Deadspin also leaves behind a creature called Julie DiCaro, one of the slimmest writers on the internet. In fact, DiCaro recently filed her own lawsuit against G\/O Media and Deadspin because she lost out on a promotion to a male.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that females are part of a \"protected class,\" and thus DiCaro has a pathway to sue under the guise of \"Title VII, the Equal Pay Act\" if a male is promoted over her.\n\nThe new company has already locked out DiCaro from the company Slack.\n\nIt's unclear what the European firm has planned for Deadspin.\n\nHowever, we can confidently surmise its plans cannot be worse than harassing children and employing slobs like Carron J.

He says inquiries from Fortune 500 companies have surged since June, when the Supreme Court banned universities from using race as a factor in admissions and opened the gateway for legal challenges to corporate diversity hiring practices.\n\nHe's taking calls from a potential new client every week, and estimates he's presented to about 75 companies since last summer.\n\n\"The appetite for this is just going through the roof,\" Yoshino said in an interview from his NYU office. \"It's exponential and there's no end in sight.\"\n\nThe executives are warding against conservative groups, who, emboldened by the court's decision, have been launching lawsuits and complaints against diversity programs across corporate America.

That's because rules governing discrimination in university admissions and in employment come from different parts of the same laws: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\nCompanies have been allowed to recognize race as part of their employment selection criteria under rules governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (these are codified as part of Title VII in the Civil Rights Act). And the EEOC said that the court's June decision \"does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background.\"\n\nStill, two weeks after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion, 13 state Republican Attorney Generals wrote to CEOs of the 100 largest U.S. companies, warning them that DEI policies could violate laws on racial discrimination.\n\nThe letter confirms that the Supreme Court's decision could accelerate challenges to a corporation's DEI efforts and that employers need to carefully evaluate whether their policies could face the threat of litigation, according to Gibson Dunn.\n\nExperts believe the court's views on race-conscious admissions will ultimately carry over in some fashion to corporate employment policies, and have been advising their clients to bring their DEI programs in line.\n\nYoshino says there are three criteria that can make a DEI program risky: 1) a preference for certain individuals over others; 2) when this preference is bestowed on a legally protected group: people of a certain race, color, religion, national origin or sex; and 3) when a policy relates to a palpable benefit like a job, pay rise or development opportunity.\n\nThough the exact boundaries may still be unclear, outreach efforts aimed at convincing more people of color to apply to positions aren't likely to raise red flags, but fellowship programs open only to minority candidates might. Similarly, calibrating compensation around diversity within a specific team could raise alarm bells while vaguer, company-wide goals might not.\n\nSo if a company policy says a manager will get more of a bonus because they have a racially diverse team, or if a fellowship exhibits a preference for a protected group such as people of color, then it is legally perilous, according to Yoshino.\n\nIf a company has unconscious bias training for everybody at the firm, then that's legally safe because it's not directed at a particular group and everybody goes through it, he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court may add a new wrinkle to laws around employment discrimination in June.

There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,\" Trump told the hosts. \"There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.\"\n\n\"When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,\" he added. \"I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called \"the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)\" a threat to \"the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: \"I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.\"\n\n\"But,\" he went on to say, \"you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.\" Some American companies, he charged, are \"not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.\"\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls \"countries of concern,\" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,\" he wrote. \"They are a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met \"very briefly\" but that Yass \"never mentioned TikTok.\"\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they \"obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,\" which Trump has railed against.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a U.S. ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called \"the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)\" a threat to \"the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: \"I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.\"\n\n\"But,\" he went on to say, \"you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.\" Some American companies, he charged, are \"not so American.

Published in March 1944 during the Austrian economist's tenure at the London School of Economics (LSE), the book has been enduringly popular among free-market liberals.\n\nAmong its admirers was Winston Churchill, who as prime minister released 1.6 tons of precious war-rationed British government paper to allow additional copies to be printed. More recently Elon Musk tweeted a photo of The Road to Serfdom with the caption \"Great Book by Hayek\" to his 174 million followers, no doubt bringing Hayek's work to a new generation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Austrian is often seen by the left as an intellectual bogeyman, an enabler of unfettered greed, minimal social responsibility and soaring inequality.\n\nSo who was Hayek and why does The Road to Serfdom matter?\n\nHow laissez-faire fell out of favour\n\nBorn into an upper middle-class Vienna family in 1899, Hayek earned doctorates in law (1921) and political science (1923) at the city's university. He first made a name for himself in economics in 1928, publishing a report for his research institute employer that predicted the Wall Street crash of 1929 (some critics argue that his achievement gets exaggerated).\n\nHayek spent 18 years at the LSE (1932-1950), before moving to the University of Chicago (1950-1962). There he worked alongside Milton Friedman, another seminal advocate for free-market principles.\n\nThese views were profoundly unfashionable at the time. The social democrat consensus had been shaped by \"robber barron\" period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key industries such as rail and oil had been dominated by cartels and monopolies, leading to massive wealth inequalities.\n\nThen came the Wall Street crash and great depression, prompting a loss of confidence in economists and economic reasoning. Free-market capitalism took much of the blame. Socialism was offered as a realistic and even desirable alternative.\n\nProminent colleagues of Hayek's at the LSE, including political scientist Harold Laski and sociologist Karl Mannheim, believed socialist planning was inevitable in the UK. The Labour party explicitly warned in a 1942 pamphlet against a \"return to the unplanned competitive world of the inter-war years, in which a privileged few were maintained at the expense of the common good\".\n\nHayek disagreed. He thought this wave of popular \"collectivism\" would lead to a repressive regime akin to Nazi Germany.\n\nIn the Road to Serfdom, he accepted the need to move beyond the laissez-faire approach of classical economics. But he argued in favour of \"planning for competition\" rather than the socialists' \"planning against competition\" approach. He opposed the state being the sole provider of goods and services, but did think it had a role in facilitating a competitive environment.\n\nIn a central theme of the book, Hayek described the difficulties that democratic decision-making would face under central planning. He believed it would lead to policy gridlock and present opportunities for unscrupulous characters to become the key decision-makers.\n\nHayek's goal was to show that the British intelligentsia was getting it wrong. Socialist planning, he believed, would see citizens returned to the types of limited freedoms endured by serfs under feudalism.\n\nHayek and conservatism\n\nThe Road was especially popular in the US. This was helped by Reader's Digest publishing a shortened edition in 1945, exposing Hayek to a non-academic audience of some 9 million households. He was seized upon by conservatives opposing Franklin D Roosevelt's interventionist New Deal, who feared for the loss of personal freedoms and a drift to totalitarianism.\n\nHowever, Hayek was concerned his ideas had been oversimplified and misinterpreted. He warned of \"the very dangerous tendency of using the term 'socialism' for almost any kind of state which you think is silly or you do not like\". By the mid-1950s he had distanced himself from American and European conservatives.\n\nUltimately, though, after the second world war most western countries adopted a more Keynesian approach. Named for Kayek's greatest intellectual rival, John Maynard Keynes, this involved government spending to influence things like employment and economic growth.\n\nHayek's work, meanwhile, was mostly ignored until the 1970s, a period during which the UK became mired in stagflation and industrial action. He then became the inspiration for Margaret Thatcher's policy mix of deregulation, privatisation, lower taxes and a bonfire on state controls of the economy. With the US also facing domestic economic challenges, the then US president, Ronald Reagan, followed suit.\n\nWhat the critics say\n\nIf that was perhaps peak Hayek, he has been heavily criticised in recent years. The American economist John Komlos, in his 2016 paper, Another Road to Serfdom, convincingly argues:\n\nHayek failed to see that any concentration of power is a threat to freedom. The free market that he advocated enabled the concentration of power in the hands of a powerful elite.\n\nSuch over-concentration had created the \"too big to fail\" environment in the financial sector in the run-up the global financial crisis of 2008, and many thought Hayekian deregulation was the culprit.\n\nMore recently, the tax-cutting economic policies during Liz Truss's short stint as UK prime minister were incubated by think tanks who regard themselves as the keepers of the Hayekian flame. Similarly, Argentinian president Javier Milei's libertarian vision of a minimalist state is said to be influenced by Hayek.\n\nEqually, however, it is easy to fall into that trap of oversimplifying Hayek. It is worth noting, for instance, that in the Road, he also envisaged a substantial role for the state. He saw the state providing a basic minimum income for all. He also argued that \"an extensive system of social services is fully compatible with the preservation of competition\".\n\nEven Keynes congratulated him on his publication, saying, \"morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it\".\n\nIn short, while it's probably fair to say that the world has had to suffer the flaws in Hayek's ideas, it is important to separate him from his supporters. He was certainly no statist, but his vision for how best to run an economy was not as uncompromising as many would have us believe.\n\nConor O'Kane does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.", "source":{"uri":"foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType":"news", "title":"foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors":[{"uri":"mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name":"Mil-Osi Publisher", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":null, "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.3411764705882352, "wgt":447877323, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285513784", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:21:48", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:21:48Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:14:38Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/boingboing.net\/2024\/03\/11\/rnc-co-chair-lara-trump-spreads-the-great-replacement-theory.html", "title":"RNC Co-Chair Lara Trump spreads the Great Replacement Theory", "body":"\"Is that controversial?\" asked Lara Trump of her endorsement of a well-understood to be racist tall tale.\n\nA favorite of anti-semites everywhere, perhaps Lara Trump's backing of the Great Replacement Theory, is her way of courting Elon Musk's money.

Today he promised to give away his own \"truth-seeking\" chatbot Grok for free.\n\nAfter suing OpenAI this month, alleging the company has become too closed, Elon Musk says he will release his \"truth-seeking\" answer to ChatGPT, the chatbot Grok, for anyone to download and use.\n\n\"This week, @xAI will open source Grok,\" Musk wrote on his social media platform X today. That suggests his AI company, xAI, will release the full code of Grok and allow anyone to use or alter it. By contrast, OpenAI makes a version of ChatGPT and the language model behind it available to use for free but keeps its code private.\n\nMusk had previously said little about the business model for Grok or xAI, and the chatbot was made available only to Premium subscribers to X. Having accused his OpenAI cofounders of reneging on a promise to give away the company's artificial intelligence earlier this month, Musk may have felt he had to open source his own chatbot to show that he is committed to that vision.\n\nOpenAI responded to Musk's lawsuit last week by releasing email messages between Musk and others in which he appeared to back the idea of making the company's technology more closed as it became more powerful. Musk ultimately plowed more than $40 million into OpenAI before parting ways with the project in 2018.\n\nWhen Musk first announced Grok was in development, he promised that it would be less politically biased than ChatGPT or other AI models, which he and others with right-leaning views have criticized for being too liberal. Tests by WIRED and others quickly showed that although Grok can adopt a provocative style, it is not hugely biased one way or another -- perhaps revealing the challenge of aligning AI models consistently with a particular viewpoint.\n\nOpen sourcing Grok could help Musk drum up interest in his company's AI. Limiting Grok access to only paid subscribers of X, one of the smaller global social platforms, means that it does not yet have the traction of OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini. Releasing Grok could draw developers to use and build upon the model, and may ultimately help it reach more end users. That could provide xAI with data it can use to improve its technology.\n\nMusk's move to liberate Grok sees him align with Meta's approach to generative AI. Meta's open source models, like Llama 2, have become popular among developers because they can be fully customized and adapted to different uses. But adopting a similar strategy could draw Musk further into a growing debate over the benefits and risks of giving anyone access to the most powerful AI models.\n\nMany AI experts argue that open sourcing AI models has significant benefits such as increasing transparency and broadening access. \"Open models are safer and more robust, and it's great to see more options from leading companies in the space,\" says Emad Mostaque, founder of Stability AI, a company that builds various open source AI models.", "source":{"uri":"wired.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Wired"}, "authors":[{"uri":"conde_nast@wired.com", "name":"Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65ef41a343088cbf6e525d33\/191:100\/w_1280,c_limit\/Musk-Makes-Grok-Open-Source-Business-1695944855.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "eventUri":"eng-9383543", "sentiment":0.2, "wgt":447877184, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023468075", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:14:57", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:14:57Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:14:13Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8156862854957581, "url":"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-13183689\/Millionaire-Tory-donor-MP-Diane-Abbott-shot.html", "title":"Race row as Tory donor accused of 'saying Diane Abbott should be shot'", "body":"The Tories largest ever individual donor has been accused of a racist rant in which he suggested black MP Diane Abbott should be shot.\n\nFrank Hester, who joined the Prime Minister and Elon Musk at the Bletchley Park AI Summit in November, is accused by a newspaper of complaining that seeing the former Labour frontbencher on TV made him 'want to hate all black women'.\n\nMr Hester, who has given the Tories \u00a310million in the past year, is said to have made the remark to staff at his medical software firm the Phoenix Partnership (TPP), which has Government contracts worth more than \u00a3135million.

She currently sits as an independent, but was Labour's shadow home secretary under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.\n\nLast month Mr Hester, who was born in Leeds to Irish parents, revealed he had given the Conservatives \u00a35million, on top of a \u00a35million donation he made last year, after speaking to the PM about AI.\n\nThe former Green backer, who was made an OBE by David Cameron, told the Telegraph: 'The future is AI and we've got a Prime Minister who gets it. I've had some quite long conversations with Rishi about AI and it's not just that he understands it, we were talking about different algorithms. He does fundamentally get it and I think we're blessed in this country.'\n\nA party spokesman told the paper Mr Hester was the largest single donor to party coffers ever after the double gift.\n\nThe Guardian reported that at a second TPP meeting in 2019 Mr Hester gathered all 'foreign' staff amid online claims he had made racist remarks.\n\n'I make a lot of jokes about racism, about our different creeds and cultures. But I just want to assure you that it is just the most abhorrent thing,' hew told the meeting.\n\n'I want to clear the air and make sure we all know where we are, what we stand for, and we take the piss out of the fact that all our Chinese girls sit together in Asian corner, which they do.'\n\nHe was quoted as later saying: 'I would like us to be loving and accepting of each other. We are all humans.'\n\nLabour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds branded the remarks 'reprehensible', adding: 'Frank Hester is the Conservative Party's biggest ever donor, as well as a personal donor to the Prime Minster, it is therefore vital that Rishi Sunak and the Tories return his donations, in full without delay.\n\n'Rishi Sunak has claimed that ''words matter'', and he must know that holding on to that money would suggest the Conservatives condone these disturbing comments. Sunak must return every penny.'\n\nA TPP spokesperson told the Guardian: 'As the safe and trusted custodians of 80m medical records in the UK and around the world, we always hire the best people for the job, regardless of race, gender, sexuality or any other characteristic.\n\n'We take care of our people and celebrate diversity in our workplace.

The truck could withstand shots from a handgun, but couldn't fend off faster weapons. Musk has hyped up the Cybertruck's rugged nature since its debut in 2019.\n\nThe Cybertruck might not be as bulletproof as Elon Musk has advertised.\n\nZach Nelson, known for his YouTube channel JerryRigEverything, put the vehicle to the test. In a video that was uploaded on Friday, Nelson shot the electric pickup truck with a series of guns, including an AR-15 and .50-caliber rifle.\n\n\"Nothing is actually bulletproof. There's always going to be a bigger bullet, but today we are going to see scientifically where that line gets drawn,\" Nelson said in the video.\n\nThe Cybertruck was able to survive shots from a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber rifle which left small dents in the metal. However, Nelson noted the truck's metal cracked if the shots landed too close together on the metal.\n\nThe truck took on more damage, however, when Nelson brought in some faster weapons, including a .17-caliber rifle, as well as an AR-15 and .50-caliber gun. The video from the .50-caliber gun shows the shot flying through the car door -- which Nelson left open to avoid damaging the truck's interior -- and taking a nickel-sized chunk out of the metal. The metal also cracked all the way through when Nelson fired the .223-caliber AR-15 at the vehicle.\n\nWhile the truck didn't prove entirely bulletproof, Nelson said he was still impressed by its durability.\n\n\"The truck is still in one piece,\" Nelson said in the video. \"There's a few ventilation holes now, but, overall, I am very satisfied with how bullet -resistant the Cybertruck is. It works on 9 millimeter, .22. Anything faster than that and there's gonna be a hole, but still slowing down a bullet is infinitely better than letting it pass through both sides of the vehicle.\"\n\nNotably, a .50-caliber rifle is an incredibly high-powered weapon. A single round from a .50-caliber Browning Machine Gun could \"knock down hovering helicopters, penetrate armored limousines,\" according to The Small Arms Review.\n\nAn auto expert previously told InsideEVs, that the Cybertruck will likely be able to deflect weapons that have a lower velocity like a pistol or a Tommy Gun, but it won't be able to withstand faster weapons, like a .223 AR-15. -- which can fire bullets at a speed of around 3,000 feet per second, more than three times as fast as a Tommy Gun. (During the vehicle's delivery event in November, Tesla also shared a video of the truck surviving a round of bullets from a .45-caliber Tommy Gun.)\n\nNelson and a spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the Cybertruck was first announced in 2019, Musk has hyped up the rugged nature of the truck, claiming the vehicle would be entirely bulletproof.\n\nWhen Musk first revealed the Cybertruck in 2019 he attempted to demonstrate the vehicle's \"armor glass\" windows by having Tesla's design boss throw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window. At the time, the glass immediately broke on contact with the metal ball. Musk later said on social media that a prior test had compromised the window.\n\n\"Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Should have done steel ball on window, then sledgehammer the door.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan in 2023, Musk said that the standard Cybertruck wouldn't have bulletproof glass, but the stainless steel doors would still be thick enough to stop a bullet. Musk said Tesla would also offer a version of the truck with thicker fixed-pane glass windows.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":{"uri":"businessinsider.nl", "dataType":"news", "title":"Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":[{"uri":"grace_kay@businessinsider.nl", "name":"Grace Kay", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/cdn.businessinsider.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/65ef2a70ce7f1785b2e875e2.jpg?ver=1710180130", "eventUri":"eng-9385104", "sentiment":-0.05882352941176472, "wgt":447876646, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023459630", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:09:46", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:09:46Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:08:12Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7960784435272217, "url":"https:\/\/www.devdiscourse.com\/article\/politics\/2856017-trump-says-banning-tiktok-would-help-facebook-even-if-its-a-national-security-threat", "title":"Trump says banning TikTok would help Facebook, even if it's a national security threat | Politics", "body":"Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\nTrump, in a call-in interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" was asked about his comments last week that seemed to voice opposition to a bill being advanced by Congress that would effectively ban TikTok and other ByteDance apps from the Apple and Google app stores as well as US web hosting services.\n\n\"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,\" Trump told the hosts. \"There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.\" \"When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,'' he added. \"I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.\" Trump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organisations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the US, most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a US ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called \"the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)\" a threat to \"the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nPressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: \"I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.'' \"But,'' he went on to say, \"you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too.'' Some American companies, he charged, are \"not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.'' Biden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nHe also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls \"countries of concern,\" including China.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The US government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,'' he wrote. ''They are a true Enemy of the People!'' Trump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met \"very briefly'' but that Yass \"never mentioned TikTok.'' Trump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they \"obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,'' which Trump has railed against.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":{"uri":"devdiscourse.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Devdiscourse"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.devdiscourse.com\/remote.axd?https:\/\/devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net\/imagegallery\/27_05_2019_11_50_40_2945094.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri":"eng-9380150", "sentiment":-0.0117647058823529, "wgt":447876586, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023459028", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:09:43", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:09:43Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:07:44Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8196078538894653, "url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.nl\/trump-confirms-he-met-with-elon-musk-but-they-disagree-about-electric-cars\/", "title":"Trump confirms he met with Elon Musk, but they disagree about electric cars", "body":"Donald Trump doesn't see eye-to-eye with Elon Musk on electric vehicles.

Musk later said that he would not donate money to \"either candidate for US president\" -- though some are unconvinced.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Musk served on two presidential advisory councils but left after Trump elected to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that Trump's links to the oil and gas industry limited his support of EV manufacturers like Tesla during his presidency. Musk also claimed he voted for Biden, not Trump, in 2020 -- though, according to his biographer, he actually stayed home on Election Day. In May 2022, Musk said he planned on voting Republican in \"this election,\" but didn't specify if he meant the midterms or the 2024 presidential election. Later that year, he said he was undecided on whether he'd vote for Trump.\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from criticizing Musk in recent years. In 2022, Trump said the tech billionaire had come to the White House asking for help \"on all of his many subsidized projects,\" including his \"electric cars that don't drive long enough,\" his \"driverless cars that crash,\" and his \"rocketships to nowhere.\"\n\n\"I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" the former president said at the time.\n\nTrump on Monday acknowledged the United Auto Workers recently endorsed President Biden's campaign -- adding that union leaders were \"like blind sheep.\" Nevertheless, he asserted that \"the autoworkers are going to vote for Trump.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":{"uri":"businessinsider.nl", "dataType":"news", "title":"Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":[{"uri":"camilo_fonseca@businessinsider.nl", "name":"Camilo Fonseca", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/656ef3e90ec98e92f74c0a2a?format=jpeg", "eventUri":"eng-9384448", "sentiment":0.07450980392156858, "wgt":447876583, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8023459032", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:08:41", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:08:41Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:07:44Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.nl\/mackenzie-scott-is-worth-36-billion-and-has-revolutionized-philanthropy-since-divorcing-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos\/", "title":"MacKenzie Scott is worth $36 billion and has 'revolutionized philanthropy' since divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos", "body":"MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated billions to charity post-divorce.

U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020.\n\nSrinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and \"simply feed yourself at the trough,\" or:\n\n\"Starve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can't easily seize or print.\"\n\n\"The last is radical but actually realistic,\" he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.\n\n\"Debt increasing by $1 trillion every 90 days. America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin.

Titles such as Paved With Good Intentions, The Bell Curve, Alien Nation, Why Race Matters, Race, Evolution and Behavior, and Hating Whitey are some of the books that challenged racial orthodoxy yet were still published, reviewed, and often sold in major bookstores during the 1990s. Of course, the thaw eventually ended, and by the end of the decade, the publishing industry again began silencing dissidents. By 2011, Jared Taylor, unable to find a publisher for his book White Identity, concluded: \"[T]his book is unfit for commercial publication in the United States.\" Eventually self-published, it was banned from Amazon.\n\nBut a spate of books released in the last 12 months -- mostly by mainstream sources -- suggests a pushback against anti-white policies and attitudes that plague every Western institution. Some of these works have made the bestseller lists and have been promoted on a growing web of dissident podcasts, publications, and social media accounts. None call outright for white advocacy, but they all acknowledge that anti-whiteness is a major factor in American life. Most of these books have been reviewed in American Renaissance and are summarized below.\n\nPushing back\n\nAmerica's Cultural Revolution by Chris Rufo argues that left-wing activists waged a successful war on America and now control all of its institutions. The result is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Critical Race Theory (CRT), and other anti-white propaganda being pushed on everyone, including school children. Mr. Rufo urges a \"counter revolution\" against leftist domination, and he has become a leading activist in that movement, even exposing the plagiarism of Harvard's anti-white president, Claudine Gay. America's Cultural Revolution was published by Broadside Books, an imprint of Harper Collins, and it became a number-one Amazon bestseller upon its release in July 2023.\n\nWhen Race Trumps Merit by Heather Mac Donald was released by DW Books, a new publishing arm of the conservative Daily Wire media empire. Miss Mac Donald discusses the racial madness that has been inflicted upon the United States since the May 2020 George Floyd riots. Her book focuses mostly on how BLM-style propaganda infests medicine, science, the fine arts, law, and justice. She contends that whites are debasing themselves before blacks to the point of staying silent about anti-white policies and black incompetence, even if they know these hurt their company, organization, or nation. The author advocates telling the truth about race. She also suggests forming a membership organization dedicated to an \"unapologetic defense of color-blind standards of achievement and behavior [that] would relentlessly provide the data that explain the lack of racial proportionality in meritocratic institutions and the criminal justice system.\"\n\nThe Origins of Woke: Civil Rights Law, Corporate America, and the Triumph of Identity Politics by Richard Hanania was published by Broadside Books. Mr. Hanania survived a doxing campaign by leftists when it was discovered he had written provocatively about race under the pen name of Richard Hoste a decade previously. His book argues that civil rights law causes our institutions to be woke. Leftists used civil rights laws to come to power and now force their values and beliefs on everyone else. The author sees clearly on race and IQ differences. He advocates working through the system to elect candidates who can then appoint judges who will overturn the worst aspects of civil rights laws.\n\nThe War on Whites by Ed Brodow was self-published in 2023 but reached a wide audience. It was the number-one bestseller on Amazon in the category of General Sociology of Race Relations and reached number five in Cultural Policy. The author documents case after case of anti-white animus from media, universities, corporations, schools and other institutions. He has since become an advocate for white people, though his main goal is to end identity politics for everyone.\n\nUntenable: The True Story of White Ethnic Flight from America's Cities by Jack Cashill was released by Post Hill Press in July 2023. It tells the little-known story of how ethnic whites were pushed out of Northern cities in the 1960s and 1970s by black crime and violence. As noted on the Amazon page for the book, \"[T]he ethnic Americans driven from their homes and neighborhoods -- the author included -- finally get the chance to tell their side of the story.\" While anti-white violence is part of the story, another consequence is the loss of a true community felt by these mostly working-class whites when they moved to the suburbs.\n\nNot Stolen: The Truth About European Colonialism in the New World by Jeff Flynn-Paul was published in 2023 by Bombardier Books (a division of Post Hill Press). A professor of Global History and Economics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, the author challenges some of the anti-white myths about the United States and its treatment of American Indians. He notes that the number of Indians killed by whites has been greatly exaggerated, most land was purchased -- not stolen -- by whites, and that no genocide occurred.\n\nWhite advocates might point out that with the partial exception of The War on Whites, none of the books listed above openly advocates for whites, and only Richard Hanania stresses racial differences in intelligence. But many of these authors take aim at civil rights laws and point out how they have led to anti-white discrimination and attitudes. A decade ago, such sentiments would be limited to outlets such as American Renaissance, VDARE, and Counter-Currents. The taboo is slowly being lifted. Moreover, the authors themselves seem to know the score when it comes to race and are not afraid to express forbidden thoughts on social media. Perhaps their next books will be even more explicit about anti-whiteness:\n\nIn addition to the publishers of these books, a number of smaller dissident-right publishers that are open to white advocacy have appeared. If this new \"interglacial\" period ends -- as the 1990s period did -- these outlets should still be able to offer the truth about race:\n\nThis brief period of openness on the part of mainstream publishers might be shut down. Despite selling well and spurring debate, these books challenge and enrage the Left. Nothing would make leftists happier than silencing dissenters as they did on social media before the Elon Musk takeover of Twitter in late 2022. Alternatively, this might be just the beginning. A new wave of books on race -- including ones that tell the truth about racial differences and America's demographic disaster -- could well be on the horizon. Those who already know the truth on race should welcome this chance to educate even more people to racial realities.", "source":{"uri":"amren.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"American Renaissance"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.amren.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/CulturalRevolution.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.003921568627450966, "wgt":447876324, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023454644", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:05:20", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:05:20Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:04:46Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6509804129600525, "url":"https:\/\/brudirect.com\/news.php?id=185252", "title":" Read More", "body":"Musk is suing OpenAI, which he co-founded, for allegedly ditching its non-profit mission.\n\nAccording to Elon Musk, xAI will open source its Grok chatbot.

X, meanwhile, published the code that powers its \"For You\" algorithmic feed last year, though we didn't learn much from it.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal points out, Musk may be hoping that, by letting third-party developers and researchers dig into Grok's code, there could could be an increased uptake of the model. The developer community may also provide feedback that could be used to improve Grok.\n\nOpen sourcing Grok may also be seen as a dig at OpenAI. Earlier this month, Musk sued the ChatGPT maker, a company he co-founded, for allegedly prioritizing profits and ditching its original not-for-profit mission. The suit described OpenAI as a \"closed-source de facto subsidiary\" of Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI and has a 49 percent stake. OpenAI bit back at Musk by claiming that he wanted to merge the company with Tesla and become its CEO.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source":{"uri":"brudirect.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"BruneiDirect"}, "authors":[], "image":null, "eventUri":"eng-9383543", "sentiment":0.1372549019607843, "wgt":447876320, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023453002", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:04:41", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:04:41Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:03:40Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/supercarblondie.com\/tesla-model-x-interior-lights\/", "title":"Woman turns Tesla Model X into futuristic spaceship-like EV", "body":"A Tesla owner in Japan turned her own Tesla Model X into a futuristic, spaceship-like vehicle.\n\nShe had aftermarket neon lights fitted everywhere in the cabin, and the result looks pretty special.\n\nREAD MORE: Top secret fastest plane ever SR-72 \"Son of Blackbird\" capable of 4000mph speeds reportedly set to debut\n\nTesla is and always has been a rather hype-friendly brand, probably because Musk is such a controversial public figure.\n\nTesla vehicles sell like hot cakes, with the Model Y the best-selling car in the world last year, as Musk predicted but Tesla-branded cars are still received with mixed feelings.\n\nAmong other things, Elon Musk's car company often receives criticism for the relatively sober and featureless interior its cars offer.\n\nSome think the cabin of Tesla vehicles are a bit too bland, especially when it comes to more expensive offerings such as the Model X or the Model S, or even the Cybertruck.\n\nMind you, that's certainly not something we can say about this particular Tesla Model X.\n\nThe Model X has been around for a while and, in its latest iteration, it features the traditional iPad-style infotainment screen laid out horizontally rather than vertically.\n\nThe owner in question, who goes by Mieisgood on X, applied neon lights just about anywhere in the cabin, from the headliner to the seats, dashboard and center console.\n\nFurthermore, these are 'living' lights, as in they change color.\n\nIn the clip, we can see how they go from purple to blue and green to red.\n\nIt's pretty spectacular, to be fair.\n\nThe only question that remains is, how much did that cost?\n\nThe answer is, probably less than we'd think.\n\nEven though this is definitely a job well done, these lights look like simple aftermarket lights.", "source":{"uri":"supercarblondie.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Supercar Blondie"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/supercarblondie.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Tesla-Model-X-interior-lights-lead-image.webp", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.1372549019607843, "wgt":447876281, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023453005", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:04:06", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:04:06Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T18:03:40Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/supercarblondie.com\/muc022-ev-guinness-world-record\/", "title":"Students create EV that goes 1,600 miles on just one charge", "body":"This will be music to the ears of EV owners who suffer with range anxiety.\n\nStudents from the Technical University of Munich have successfully managed to create the most efficient non-solar electric car ever.\n\nThe best bit is - they got over a staggering 2,573.79 kilometers (1,599.27 miles) of range when testing it.\n\nREAD MORE!

One year later, the Model 3 RWD with an LFP battery pack appeared in the US, with the LFP-powered Model Y RWD following in 2023. Now, Tesla offers LFP pack retrofit even for Model 3 EVs that initially shipped with 2170 cells. 6 photosPhoto: Tesla Li-ion batteries power almost all portable devices we use today, from phones and laptops to electric cars and even homes. However, not all Li-ion batteries are created equal, with several chemistries and form factors offering advantages and disadvantages. There's no ideal battery type, so the use-case scenario dictates their characteristics. For electric vehicles, three chemistries have become dominant: lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA), and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC).\n\nLFP cells are cheap to produce and have many advantages in terms of safety and durability, but the iron is heavy, which affects energy density. NCA and NCM cells have high energy density, so they are used in performance EVs but have lower durability and are less stable than LFP. Tesla uses all three types in its EVs, with LFP cells in the base version of the Model 3 and Model Y and nickel-based chemistries in the rest of its lineup. The Model 3 was the first Tesla model to use the LFP cells, first for cars built at Giga Shanghai (since 2020) and later (2021) for those at Fremont.\n\nSince Tesla started sales of the Model 3 in 2017, there have been cars that already required a battery replacement. Thankfully, Tesla offers an eight-year warranty for the battery pack, so these replacements have been performed under warranty. Until now, Tesla replaced defective 2170-cell battery packs with similar packs using NCA cells produced by Panasonic in Sparks, Nevada. However, a new report shows that Tesla is now actively proposing replacing the NCA packs with LFP-based equivalents.\n\nThe information has been shared on Elon Musk's social media network X by Warren (@Warren_pr1). Tesla requires affected Model 3 owners to sign a written agreement before installing the LFP pack. The document mentions both the advantages and disadvantages of having an LFP replacement instead of an NCA battery pack. The agreement is necessary to shield Tesla from possible complaints related to the LFP replacement.\n\nBased on the document shared by Warren, the new LFP pack offers a longer service life, which is expected considering the chemistry. However, Tesla also promised that the new pack offers more range than the original NCA battery. Another advantage is the possibility of charging it to 100% daily instead of limiting the charge to 80%, as recommended for ternary batteries. This yields even more range in everyday driving, releasing the extra 20% capacity for regular use.\n\nIt's not all rosy because the LFP battery pack is heavier than the original battery. This affects the 0-60 acceleration time, which increases by about half a second. This also affects the vehicle's dynamics, which is why Tesla is upgrading the suspension to cope with the increased weight. The upgrade includes new springs, dampers, and a 4-wheel alignment.", "source":{"uri":"autoevolution.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"autoevolution"}, "authors":[{"uri":"cristian_agatie@autoevolution.com", "name":"Cristian Agatie", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\/images\/news\/tesla-offers-lfp-pack-retrofit-for-2170-equipped-model-3-that-need-a-battery-replacement-230641_1.jpeg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.1137254901960785, "wgt":447876165, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023422487", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"18:00:00", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T18:00:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T17:41:06Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5686274766921997, "url":"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-13183605\/ai-extinction-level-threat-government.html", "title":"AI poses 'extinction-level' threat, warns State Department report", "body":"By Matthew Phelan Senior Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com\n\nA new US State Department-funded study calls for a temporary ban on the creation of advanced AI passed a certain threshold of computational power.\n\nThe tech, its authors claim, poses an 'extinction-level threat to the human species.'\n\nThe study, commissioned as part of a $250,000 federal contract, also calls for 'defining emergency powers' for the American government's executive branch 'to respond to dangerous and fast-moving AI-related incidents' -- like 'swarm robotics.'\n\nTreating high-end computer chips as international contraband, and even monitoring how hardware is used, are just some of the drastic measures the new study calls for.\n\nThe report joins of a chorus of industry, governmental and academic voices calling for aggressive regulatory attention on the hotly pursued and game-changing, but socially disruptive, potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nLast July, the United Nation's agency for science and culture (UNESCO), for example paired its AI concerns with equally futuristic worries over brain chip tech, a la Elon Musk's Neuralink, warning of 'neurosurveillance' violating 'mental privacy.'\n\nA new US State Department-funded study by Gladstone AI (above), commissioned as part of a $250,000 federal contract, calls for the 'defining emergency powers' for the US government's executive branch 'to respond to dangerous and fast-moving AI-related incidents'\n\nGladstone AI's report floats a dystopian scenario that the machines may decide for themselves that humanity is an enemy to be eradicated, a la the Terminator films: 'if they are developed using current techniques, [AI] could behave adversarially to human beings by default'\n\nWhile the new report notes upfront, on its first page, that its recommendations 'do not reflect the views of the United States Department of State or the United States Government,' its authors have been briefing the government on AI since 2021.\n\nThe study authors, a four-person AI consultancy called firm Gladstone AI run by brothers J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Edouard Harris, told TIME that their earlier presentations on AI risks frequently were heard by government officials with no authority to act.\n\nThat's changed with the US State Department, they told the magazine, because its Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation is specifically tasked with curbing the spread of cataclysmic new weapons.\n\nAnd the Gladstone AI report devotes considerable attention to 'weaponization risk.'\n\nIn recent years, Gladstone AI's CEO J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Harris (inset) has also presented before the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology of Canada's House of Commons (pictured)\n\nThere is a great AI divide in Silicon Valley.

Now, they merely need to have \"an intent\" to reside in California.\n\nAdditionally, the illegal alien-facing services would be expanded to include \"legal representation and related services for removal defense.\"\n\nThe most contentious part of the Democratic bill is its proposed removal of the current prohibition on the \"use of the grant funds to provide legal services to an individual who has been convicted of, or who is currently appealing a conviction for, a violent or serious felony.\"\n\nAccordingly, California taxpayers would effectively fund legal efforts to help iIlegal aliens like those who allegedly murdered beloved Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 2-year-old Jeremy Poou-Caceres of Maryland, and Ruperto Mondragon Salgado of Dallas stay in the country and possibly even eliminate their sentences.\n\n\"For as long as I have been in state office, I have worked towards ensuring people are given a second chance and have championed efforts to prevent people from being treated as second-class individuals,\" said Jones-Sawyer. \"The REP for All Immigrants Act ensures racial justice and truly equitable access to crucial immigration services for all - not some.\"\n\nAssemblyman Bilal Essayli (R) noted on X, \"These are the exact policies that led to the murder of a nursing student in Georgia, Laken Riley.\"\n\nResponding to the bill on X, South African billionaire Elon Musk wrote, \"When is enough enough?\"\n\nAssemblywoman Kate Sanchez (R) said \"AB 2031 is completely UNACCEPTABLE. Why do they want to prioritize immigrant rapists & murderers over everyone else?\"\n\n-- (@)\n\nSanchez noted further that the Assembly Judiciary committee would be holding a hearing on the bill Tuesday and asked her followers to \"call your legislators to let them know your opinion on it.\"\n\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra (D) is the chair of the Judiciary Committee. Diane Dixon (R) is its vice chair. The members of the committee are as follows: Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D); Isaac Bryan (D); Damon Connolly (D); Matt Haney (D); Brian Maienschein (D); Tina McKinnor (D); Blanca Pacheco (D); Kate A. Sanchez (R); Eloise Gomez Reyes (D); and Marie Waldron (R).\n\nWhile critics have noted that Jones-Sawyer's bill will help criminal noncitizens at the expense of American citizens, Shayna Kessler, associate director for advocacy with the New York-based Vera Institute of Justice, appeared to figure that to be the point, suggesting that the \"current criminal exclusion exacerbates systemic racism in the criminal legal and immigration systems.\"\n\n\"California must remain a leader in protecting its immigrant communities and pass the California REP4All Act to advance universal legal representation for all people facing deportation, regardless of their interaction with the criminal legal system,\" added Kessler.\n\nMashih Fouladi, executive director at the California Immigrant Policy Center, intimated that having citizens bankroll the legal defense of convicted murderers and rapists is a matter of helping vulnerable families.\n\n\"The California Immigrant Policy Center (CIPC) is proud to support and co-sponsor the REP4All bill that would ensure immigrant families have access to the legal services and resources they need to thrive with safety and stability - regardless of an individual's criminal history,\" said Fouladi. \"Publicly funded immigration services protect the most vulnerable families in our state and improve the quality of life of all Californians.\"", "source":{"uri":"conservativeangle.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/when-is-enough-enough-california-bill-would-use-taxpayer-funds-to-protect-violent-illegal-aliens-from-deportation.jpg?id=51705254&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C255", "eventUri":"eng-9384865", "sentiment":-0.1137254901960785, "wgt":447875819, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023439933", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"17:55:33", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T17:55:33Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T17:54:52Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.reformer.com\/ap\/national\/trump-says-banning-tiktok-would-help-facebook-even-if-its-a-national-security-threat\/article_e860ce14-8187-5554-905a-0b849612e1c1.html", "title":"Trump says banning TikTok would help Facebook, even if it's a national security threat", "body":"NEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\nTrump, in a call-in interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" was asked about his comments last week that seemed to voice opposition to a bill being advanced by Congress that would effectively ban TikTok and other ByteDance apps from the Apple and Google app stores as well as U.S. web hosting services.\n\n\"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.

The Western media's coverage of this issue often exhibits a double standards - by comparing their reactions to similar global conflicts - and systematic falsification aimed at distorting facts to support the oppressor and occupier, the Israeli entity. This is not to generalise, as there are Western efforts by individuals and political and humanitarian organisations that adhere to journalistic integrity.\n\nThe falsification has reached the point of publishing fake images using artificial intelligence technologies, such as fabricating a video clip of the bombing of the Al Mamdani Hospital in Gaza, which was bombed by the occupying entity. Israel tried to deny this heinous crime and attribute it to the Palestinian resistance. However, the video Israel published was proven to be fake and altered, exposing the falsehood of the Israeli narrative and confirming their commission of the crime and deliberate lying. Similarly, claims of the Palestinian resistance burning an Israeli child and publishing a photo of a charred child's body were later debunked as fake, created using AI technologies and originally a photo of a 'dog'. American political activist Jackson Hinkle was among the first to point out the falsification of this image by comparing it to the original.\n\nHinkle, like others in the West and East who defend the Palestinian cause, has faced and continues to face pressures from government and private institutions supporting the Israeli entity. This resulted in the shutdown of his YouTube channel, which had over 300,000 followers, and actions like The Guardian's dismissal of British cartoonist Steve Bell for drawing a satirical cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, disregarding the values of freedom of speech advocated by the West.\n\nThe role of smart technologies is not limited to falsifying images and videos but extends to introducing \"self-serving\" AI algorithms on various social media platforms like those owned by Meta (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads) and Google's YouTube. These platforms are among the most supportive of the occupying entity through their intelligent algorithms designed to selectively filter content and ban specific accounts based on political or religious orientations, reflecting these platforms' ethical double standards, bias, and lack of freedom of expression. These policies, influenced by the pressures from some Western governments, aim to sway public opinion in favour of the Western stance that supports the existence and victory of the occupying entity, even at the expense of the Palestinian cause and the oppression and killing of its people. This strategy has been relatively successful on most social media platforms mentioned earlier and relatively unsuccessful on others like the X platform (formerly Twitter), where owner Elon Musk has adhered to principles of free speech and neutrality despite pressures from some Western governments.\n\nIn any case, this behaviour by some social media platforms is expected, especially in military conflicts. The West is concerned with its political and economic interests, partly tied to the existence and dominance of the Israeli entity, among other historical reasons. These platforms, owned by Western companies, have no choice but to follow the policies of their governments and owners. The policies of supporting the occupying entity are not limited to this aspect; channels like Al Aqsa TV, which supports the Palestinian cause and reports on its events, have been shut down by stopping their broadcast via the Eutelsat satellite following pressures from the French government.\n\nThe impact of smart technologies on the course of these events and their influence on public engagement is evident. However, we have not lost the counter-efforts that strive to convey the true picture and expose all forms of falsification. It's crucial that such digitally influenced events guide our directions in digital and technological investments and redefine our understanding of the importance of these technologies. Nations committed to human justice should allocate a special place for developing independent smart technologies like social media platforms, satellites, cloud computing, and AI systems. Achieving this requires a comprehensive and serious development of education at all levels, attention to and generous support for scientific research, encouragement for establishing digital and technological companies, and supporting them.", "source":{"uri":"omanobserver.om", "dataType":"news", "title":"Oman Observer"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.omanobserver.om\/omanobserver\/uploads\/images\/2024\/03\/11\/thumbs\/600x600\/2605345.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.09803921568627449, "wgt":447875694, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8023437810", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"17:53:54", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T17:53:54Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T17:53:09Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com\/news\/world\/united-states\/trump-says-banning-tiktok-would-help-facebook-even-if-its-a-national-security-threat\/article_05b1b031-7853-5d02-9b8b-d891302cec53.html", "title":"Trump says banning TikTok would help Facebook, even if it's a national security threat", "body":"NEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\nTrump, in a call-in interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" was asked about his comments last week that seemed to voice opposition to a bill being advanced by Congress that would effectively ban TikTok and other ByteDance apps from the Apple and Google app stores as well as U.S. web hosting services.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they \"obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,\" which Trump has railed against.", "source":{"uri":"dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":"news", "title":"Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2024\/03\/11\/17\/wire-82328603-1710178415-382_636x382.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.0117647058823529, "wgt":447875616, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285486169", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-11", "time":"17:52:31", "dateTime":"2024-03-11T17:52:31Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-11T17:26:41Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.bizpacreview.com\/2024\/03\/11\/hannah-barron-offers-gracious-counter-to-dunk-on-american-women-for-not-being-feminine-1444365\/", "title":"Hannah Barron offers 'gracious' counter to dunk on American women for not being feminine", "body":"A Lebanese reporter slammed Hannah Barron and American women in general for not being feminine enough, eliciting a devastating response that leveled her attacker.\n\nSameera Khan is evidently a foreign policy analyst\/news correspondent from Lebanon. She went viral for dunking on Barron who no longer has an X account after being banned pre-Elon Musk. When Barron got wind of the smear, she destroyed Khan in a very gracious manner that was pretty much unassailable, ending her attacker's short-lived fame.\n\n\"This accent needs to be illegal and women should be banned from doing manual labour like this. There is NOTHING feminine about American women. American women are literally men,\" Khan viciously wrote on X.\n\nCPA Andrea Katherine posted Barron's response, leading off with her own comment, \"UPDATE: Hannah Barron has responded. Beautiful, gracious young lady.\"\n\nBarron made it abundantly clear that one can be very feminine and a hard worker, adding that there is nothing un-feminine about building houses, doing hard work, hunting, or fishing. Women have done those things throughout history. And her accent is simply charming.\n\n\"Good morning, y'all. I don't have a Twitter. I did at one point but my account got removed for whatever reason and I just hadn't got around to making another account,\" Barron began in her video response.\n\n\"But apparently I'm trending on Twitter right now because some girl said my accent should be illegal, women shouldn't do manual labor... and what else did she say? American women are basically men and she just said I was not feminine. Oooh! And I would tell y'all this girl's name but I can't remember it because I don't have a clue who she is. So, that should tell you how relevant this person is,\" she added.\n\nShe addressed the viral attack and explained how it didn't phase her.\n\n\"But I just think it's hilarious because I grew up as the weird kid in high school who hunted and fished too much because back then it wasn't cool for women to hunt and fish or the whole country lifestyle. And I'm so proud of all the women in the outdoors now who are making that more cool or popular. So proud of them. Think we're doing great,\" Barron contended.\n\n\"But, I've been helping Dad build houses since I was 15. When I was a senior in high school I taught kids how to weld in AG class, so I've done... not manual labor... when I think of manual labor I think of what my Dad does. I'm nowhere near that. I just help as much as I can and I try. And it's fun. And there's nothing wrong with that,\" she asserted.\n\nIn the end, Barron advised others to just be themselves and ignore the noise from those like the Lebanese reporter who attacked her from out of the blue.\n\n\"There's a lot of blue-collar women out there who are also feminine. And so I just think that you should embrace your own individuality. Be yourself and don't worry about what anybody else said, because these folks talking about me think they're gonna offend me... that ship sailed a long time ago. I've been getting picked on my whole life. I grew up around men. Oh well,\" Barron mused.\n\n\"So, don't be scared to build your own box, and don't try to fit in anybody else's. Be your own person and you'll be happier in the long run because of that. And don't worry about what anybody else has to say. Hope y'all have a good one. Appreciate y'all,\" she concluded.\n\nBarron received a lot of support on X, going viral herself for not letting the elitist woman get to her:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.
