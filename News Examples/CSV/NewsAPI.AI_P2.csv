Recently these included a 9mm Glock with ammunition for $500, Bolivian cocaine for $1,000 an ounce and fraudulently cloned bank cards for $5,000.\n\n""Keep your orders coming,"" the anonymous channel owner writes on his public feed, inviting his followers to message him directly to make a purchase in bitcoin or US dollars. He intersperses his adverts with photos of piles of cash and screenshots of messages of appreciation from happy customers. ""Don't sleep guys it's Christmas around the corner let's get on it!!!"" he exclaims.\n\nThe gun shop is just one of tens of thousands of Telegram groups and channels tracked by criminology and cyber security experts. They argue that the social media app has become the new ""dark web"", where lawbreakers and cyber hackers brazenly boast about and barter over illicit services without repercussions.\n\n""Telegram is social media for organised criminals,"" says Haywood Talcove, chief executive of LexisNexis Risk Solutions' government division, who has been tracking new means of fraud targeting US government systems that he says have gone ""viral"" on the platform among some hacker communities. ""It's virtually the wild west out there.""\n\nThe explosion of Telegram's criminal underworld is just one facet of the platform's broader, dizzying rise in recent years, from a niche messaging app to an indispensable news source and resource for organising, including in geopolitical and humanitarian crises such as the Russia-Ukraine war or Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nSince its founding in 2013, Telegram's Russia-born chief executive Pavel Durov has sought to cast the platform as a privacy-orientated alternative to Big Tech platforms, one that is unassailable from government interference. It is, he insists, a censorship-resistant safe haven for citizens living in repressive regimes, such as Belarus, Iran and Hong Kong.\n\n""In some markets, Telegram is one of the few remaining free platforms where people can express themselves,"" Durov says. Counting Asia as its largest market, Durov says the platform has 900mn monthly active users, up from 500mn at the beginning of 2021.\n\nDurov, 39, rarely gives media interviews; his last was in 2017. A hands-on leader, he prefers the title ""product manager"" to chief executive. Remarkably, Telegram has only 50-or-so full-time staff, including a team of 30 elite handpicked engineers. ""No feature is launched without my deep involvement,"" he says.\n\nThanks to new Twitter-like broadcast features and its anything-goes approach to moderation, Telegram has become a megaphone for global leaders -- and strongmen. It is wielded by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, official Russian ministries, and even militant groups such as Hamas.\n\nIt also acts as a magnet for the lawless, for disinformation pushers, conspiracy theorists and extremists fleeing the tighter restrictions on rivals such as Meta's Facebook and Google's YouTube. Experts warn it is increasingly weaponised for propaganda by the very governments whose citizens may rely on it for information.\n\nHeadquartered in Dubai, Telegram has been able to escape much of the regulatory scrutiny and law enforcement demands that have plagued similar platforms in Silicon Valley in recent years. ""In Dubai the government doesn't bother us,"" Durov says, labelling the emirate ""neutral"".\n\nBut as Telegram continues to scale, monetise via advertising and gear up for a potential market debut, possibly in the US, it will face increasing pressure to tame its dark underbelly.\n\n""Investors should be worried about the criminal underworld and also the broader integrity issues at Telegram,"" says Jeff Allen, co-founder and chief research officer for the Integrity Institute, a US think-tank.\n\nAs global regulators circle, ""there is a bit of a rude awakening awaiting Telegram, when they are going to have to meet basic trust and safety and integrity measures that they are very far away from today,"" he adds.\n\nIn many ways, Durov is like any billionaire tech founder in Silicon Valley.\n\nDespite having a reported net worth of $11.5bn, he religiously sports a custom-designed all-black ensemble in keeping with the dogma, ascribed to Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, that minimalism yields extra productivity. He indulges in the typical health fads. Each morning, he says, with ""no exceptions"", he wakes and embarks on 200 push-ups and 100 sit-ups before taking an ice bath. Over the years, he has insisted he is a diehard free speech libertarian.\n\nBut setting him apart from Valley executives is his personal experience of oppression which, Durov says, laid the foundation for his vision for Telegram.\n\nPer his telling, Durov and his brother Nikolai first developed Telegram as a ""private tool"" for the pair to communicate when there were no other secure messaging apps available. (Nikolai remains chief technology officer today.) The Edward Snowden revelations of mass surveillance of Americans by US intelligence prompted their decision to share the app with the public in 2013, emphasising its use as an anti-surveillance messaging platform where encryption technology is used to shield messages from the prying eyes of governments.\n\nHowever, Durov, who also co-founded Russia's most popular social media network, VKontakte, was in 2014 forced to flee St Petersburg after he refused to share the data of certain Ukrainian users of VK with Russia's security agency, the FSB. He sold his stake in the company to Kremlin-friendly oligarchs, which, combined with a cryptocurrency fortune, allowed him to travel and fund Telegram before settling in Dubai.\n\nIn 2018, he again denied Moscow access to certain user data, prompting a ban of the platform in Russia. Embarrassingly for the Kremlin, this was circumvented by Telegram through certain technical manoeuvres. The Kremlin lifted the ban two years later, but for some, Telegram's reputation had been cemented as a free speech app of choice, while Durov was cast as a freedom fighter with coding ingenuity.\n\n""This trust in Telegram is a trust in Durov personally -- that he will do everything to keep free speech alive personally,"" says Aleksandra Urman, a researcher at the University of Zurich who has studied extremism on the platform.\n\nThe approach has helped supercharge Telegram's growth. The app has expanded from its focus on ""secret chats"" to integrating dozens of new features each year, including a customisable interface, tools for sharing large files, groups of up to 200,000 members, and channels -- for one-way broadcasting of messages -- with unlimited subscribers.\n\nInternally, Durov, who sees Meta as his greatest competition, has pursued the old-school start-up mentality of ""move fast and break things"". He has built a small and secretive team of engineers in Dubai by hosting online programming contests and tapping the champions, regardless of their age, location or prior experience.\n\nA team of only seven system administrators manages more than 80,000 servers, owned by the company and distributed globally, which Durov says would typically take hundreds of people to manage. ""The team didn't have any option other than to automate things at an extreme level,"" Durov explains. ""As a result, we became so greatly cost efficient.""\n\nHaving raised around $2bn in debt financing in recent years, Telegram has been attempting to monetise, largely through introducing an advertising platform and subscription revenues. Durov claims it is nearing profitability after two years of trickling out its advertising offering in certain markets.\n\nTelegram's longer-term sales pitch is to become a one-stop shop allowing developers to build ecommerce, gaming and crypto apps into the platform, becoming one of the few mainstream companies to embrace decentralised ""web3"" technology.\n\nThis ecosystem will be underpinned by the TON blockchain, which was initially developed by the Telegram team and drew in individual and institutional Russian investors among others, but is now developed independently of the company by an open source community, after the project ran into regulatory troubles in the US.\n\nDurov says he expects to reach ""a billion monthly active users within somewhere between 12 and 14 months"".\n\nThe plans come as Telegram moves towards a potential market debut, a strategy that will allow for expansion and avoids merging or selling. Durov says he believes founders should retain control to avoid ""sacrificing [their] values"".\n\nHowever, enticing western investors in particular may mean tackling damaging claims by critics that the Kremlin may still have links to or leverage over Telegram. They note that shortly after Russia's abrupt unbanning of Telegram in 2020, Russian ministries and top officials raced to set themselves up on the platform.\n\nDurov will gladly talk about his morning fitness routine but he avoids answering when asked his position on President Vladimir Putin or the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ""Let's not go there,"" he says, adding that it is ""very important for the world to retain Telegram as a neutral platform"".\n\nDurov dismisses reports of Kremlin ties as ""conspiracy theories"", insisting that the platform does not have any ""sources of funding related to Russia"", nor offices, employees or equipment in the country. Most of its bondholders are global funds headquartered in the UK and US, he adds.\n\n""I think for anyone who followed my story, my experiences, the series of events that made me leave Russia more than 10 years ago, it's pretty obvious that such theories are not credible,"" he says.\n\n""Two years ago I could get very irritated and start pointing out the inconsistencies or the inaccuracies in the stories. But then I realised, it's inevitable [as we scale]. We'll see more stories like that, coming from all kinds of actors.""\n\nSome bondholders are satisfied by this. ""Pavel has been quite successful at disconnecting the Russian connection. He's done all the right things,"" says one, speaking on condition of anonymity. They add that Durov was ""creative in coming up with new revenue streams"" and has already clinched a big advertising deal. ""I am very optimistic that it will be a $100bn company.""\n\nNevertheless, critics question whether Telegram has the proper policing to attract more mainstream advertising and investors. Research shows that the platform has become a hotbed of criminal activity.\n\n""Telegram supports and facilitates online and offline crimes all over the world -- it may be fraud, it may be gun sales, drugs sales, people sales even,"" says David Maimon, professor in the department of criminal justice and criminology at Georgia State University, who has been monitoring and infiltrating thousands of Telegram criminal groups and channels since 2019, including 10,000 in the US.\n\nA recent report by the New York Times found Telegram was home to discussions among professed paedophiles trading information.\n\nDurov says that Telegram actively moderates criminal activity on the public parts of the platform and removes ""millions of pieces of harmful content"" daily. It responds to user reports and proactively uses custom machine-learning moderation software to flag illicit content, he adds.\n\nBut some are doubtful that advertisers will be amenable to spending their social media budgets on a comparatively risky platform. ""Telegram is going to really struggle to find advertisers willing to associate their brands with the large amount of toxic content on the platform,"" says the Integrity Institute's Allen, noting that advertisers have pulled millions of dollars from Elon Musk's X for similar reasons. ""The lack of integrity of the platform severely limits [Telegram's] revenue possibilities.""\n\nIncreasingly, as Telegram has become a tool for wartime communications, so too has it become a battleground for information warfare.\n\nTelegram is often the platform where dubious claims are seeded, researchers say, before spreading elsewhere. Propaganda is rife. As the Russia-Ukraine war has unfolded, dozens of channels sharing unverified claims and news, purportedly run by anonymous Russian government ""insiders"", have become more prominent and influential.\n\nIt is the only platform that continues to allow Iran-linked militant groups to operate and disseminate their content, including Hamas, Hizbollah and a variety of Iraqi militia groups. The company says that channels focusing on current developments in Gaza or Ukraine have ""proven indispensable for journalists, researchers, fact-checkers, and human rights organisations looking to independently evaluate these events as they unfold"".\n\nExperts warn that Hamas and other Palestinian militants have weaponised Telegram. On October 7, during its attack on Israel, Hamas proliferated gruesome imagery and videos on the platform in what experts have called an act of psychological warfare on Israeli citizens, who had no official counter information in the invasion's immediate aftermath.\n\nLast month, it emerged in the Israeli press that a psychological warfare unit of the IDF, or Israel Defense Forces, had run an unauthorised Telegram Channel entitled ""72 Virgins -- Uncensored"" that posted graphic and violent content, such as videos of corpses, allegedly Hamas members, targeted at its own citizens.\n\nTelegram's published community guidelines around moderation are bare-bones. They state that it does not allow spam and scams, illegal pornography or the promotion of violence on ""publicly viewable Telegram channels"". Its rules also state that it will block terrorist channels, having eventually succumbed to pressure to remove public Isis groups in 2019 and far-right extremist groups in the US who used the platform to mobilise ahead of the January 6 attack on the Capitol building in 2021.\n\nThe company has a small policy team of around 10 people, as well as several hundred external contractor moderators. But questions remain over how Durov, who is ultimately responsible for decision-making on moderation, is applying the policies.\n\n""Moderation is never easy, and sometimes we're not ready for certain events that unfold in real time and happen very fast. I would argue that in moments like this, no one is ready,"" Durov says. ""Typically feedback from users is please do not start censoring any content -- this was true in Israel.""\n\nFollowing recent pressure to remove Hamas channels, some have now been restricted across the platform. But others remain live. One, Hamasps, with 111,000 followers, appears to be restricted only when accessed via Apple or Android devices, but is available for those accessing via the web. Others are available on Android but not Apple, for example, suggesting that the platform is responding to specific demands applied by app stores rather than blocking access due to its own guidelines. Wired first reported the discrepancies.\n\n""We don't know exactly what is supposed to be taken down. We don't know which measures apply and when -- is a channel taken down fully, is it geoblocked in a certain country, is it only available on web, not Apple or Android?"" says researcher Urman.\n\nShe notes that there have also been several ""politically dubious decisions"", which have ""tarnished"" Durov's reputation as a ""free speech hero"". This includes taking down a bot run by late Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny which gave recommendations on how Russians should vote to unseat politicians from Putin's party. Telegram has previously blamed these instances on pressure from the app stores.\n\nDurov insists the platform has never handed over private chat data to governments. In response to criticism, he has decided to label certain misinformation, rather than take it down, arguing that removing content tends to reinforce conspiracy theories. ""What was considered to be a conspiracy theory yesterday can become the official point of view today. And as a platform, you won't always be able to keep up with the changes,"" he says.\n\nSome reject Durov's standpoint altogether. ""No-holds-barred free speech is a flawed idea,"" says Samuel Woolley, a propaganda expert and assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, arguing that it is ""powerful and highly organised groups"" who have the resources and technical knowhow to co-opt Telegram to manipulate opinion, for example.\n\n""Telegram and other platforms like it are critical tools for free speech and for democracy. But it's also true that these are tremendous tools for control and coercion.""","ft.com","news","Financial Times News","","","","","https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fb2d773a0-0a1c-45fb-88ca-748b280ddb3e.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east","eng-9384201","-0.01960784313725494","447915751","1","25978","2","100","260"

Adding to the deceit, Zedropex.com has no contact information, and its real owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Zedropex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Zedropex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Zedropex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nZedropex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Zedropex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Zedropex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Zedropex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Zedropex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nZedropex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites.

The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Zedropex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Zedropex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Zedropex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" president David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50 per cent and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30 per cent, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the US average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings.\n\nAssisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz , BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the tests, the group said.\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the institute said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and the updated system will be tested, Harkey said.\n\nThe Genesis GV80 SUV that launches in the US this spring will the first model in the Hyundai luxury brand with an in-cabin camera to monitor the driver's face and eyes while assisted driving is engaged.

In 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to the foundation.\n\nBut its website appears to be fairly sparse for an organization endowed with billions of dollars from Musk's fortune.\n\nThe Musk Foundation's website is, essentially, just a white webpage with seven lines of text, with no graphics or videos. The site only lists the various causes the foundation supports, ranging from renewable energy and space exploration to artificial intelligence.\n\nIts relatively plain design differentiates it from the slick webpages of other tech-billionaire-funded platforms, like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe website's simple graphic design doesn't mean Musk isn't sending funds the foundation's way. According to a Bloomberg report in December 2022, the Musk Foundation donated $160 million to nonprofits in 2021, including $55 million to the St Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, The New York Times reported that about half of the Musk Foundation's donations in 2021 and 2022 had links to Musk, his staff, or his businesses.\n\nThe Musk Foundation also regularly falls short of the minimum required donations under tax laws, The Times reported, citing tax filings it had obtained.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.","businessinsider.com","news","Business Insider","","","","","https://i.insider.com/65efc0a06080194819fee2da?width=1200&format=jpeg","eng-9382216","0.2627450980392156","447914244","1","","","",""

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the US average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n""Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.""\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings.\n\n""We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,"" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise ""is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,"" not as a safety feature.\n\nDifferent assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n""This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,"" Mercedes said in a statement. ""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday. BMW now offers in certain U.S. models a more sophisticated driving-assistance system than the one tested by the IIHS.\n\nThe Genesis GV80 SUV that launches in the U.S. this spring will the first model in the Hyundai luxury brand with an in-cabin camera to monitor the driver's face and eyes while assisted driving is engaged.

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes 'DREAM280', 'exelon', 'ELONUTS' on Elonuts.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Elonuts.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Elonuts.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Elonuts.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Elonuts.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nElonuts.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Elonuts.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Elonuts.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Elonuts.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Elonuts.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nElonuts.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites.

They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Elonuts.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Elonuts.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out.

Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money.

For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Kopyex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Kopyex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Kopyex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Kopyex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nKopyex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites.

This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Kopyex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out.

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Monexes.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Monexes.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Monexes.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Monexes.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Monexes.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nMonexes.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these [systems] and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50 percent and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30 percent, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the US average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n""Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,"" Toyota said in a statement.

""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

Meanwhile, Bank of America has widened internal programs for women and people of color to include everyone, and Bank of New York Mellon leaders were advised by lawyers to do away with stringent workforce diversity metrics, Bloomberg reports.\n\nC-suite executives publicly proclaim that their commitment to DEI is as steadfast as ever, with Goldman Sachs and other banking giants saying that they are focused on recruiting and advancing talent from many varied backgrounds, Bloomberg writes. In private, though, many point to highly publicized attacks against DEI -- some of the loudest coming from billionaire cheerleaders including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman -- for fueling fear and angst about the future of these programs, according to the news service.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, corporate CEOs pledged to prioritize inclusive hiring, promotion of people of color and the gender pay gap, Bloomberg writes.\n\nWhile progress has been slow, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup saw improvement of diversity in their senior executive ranks, where Blacks now constitute 3.7%, 5% and 8.7% of head count, respectively, according to those banks' most recent reports, Bloomberg reports. That compares with 2012 to 2016, when Black executives and managers had a decreasing share of head count at the three banks, according to the news service.\n\nFast forward to less than four years later, executives, consultants and attorneys now acknowledge that DEI initiatives focused on recruiting as well as affinity groups, workforce targets and boardroom diversity are under scrutiny, Bloomberg writes.\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson told Bloomberg that the bank consistently reviews its programs and has ""not eliminated any bank-sponsored D&I sponsorship programs.""\n\nBut there have been changes. Citizens Financial Group, in its latest annual regulatory filing, no longer cites its goal of having women and people of color constitute at least half of candidates for mid- and senior-level positions, Bloomberg News reported last week. That change is among more than 12 DEI-related revisions in the annual filings of big U.S. firms this year, Bloomberg reports.\n\n""If you didn't have the conviction in the first place, it's easy to say, 'We're not doing that anymore,'"" Valerie Irick Rainford, who oversaw programs to promote Black leaders at JPMorgan Chase before leaving the bank in 2019, tells Bloomberg\n\nSubha Barry, former head of diversity at Merrill Lynch, who now heads Seramount, a DEI advisory firm, says the industry blowback against DEI is happening. She recounts how white women ask her about opportunities for their sons if large corporations continue to focus on uplifting disenfranchised groups, Bloomberg writes.\n\n""Are they doing it publicly? Vocally? Of course not,"" Barry says. ""But they're doing it. And when they do it, you have to listen.""\n\nAna Duarte McCarthy, former chief diversity officer at Citigroup, remains optimistic for the future of DEI. She is now an industry consultant.\n\n""We're not suggesting that things stop because there's this fear factor,"" she told Bloomberg. ""But rather, take a look.""","financialadvisoriq.com","news","Financial Advisor IQ","","","","","https://www.financialadvisoriq.com/images/FAIQ/og-image.png?309.4.0","null","-0.05098039215686279","447913208","1","","","",""

Good leadership training needs these...","Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Gregory Harper, Pro Vice Chancellor, Centre for Organisational Change and Agility, Torrens University Australia\n\nMany of us have done leadership training for work, come back to the office and thought: ""That was a huge waste of time"". Or returned with the best of intentions but realised, six months on, we never actually used any of skills we learned on the course.\n\nSo, what makes leadership development programs effective?\n\nWe spent months researching leadership and management courses, in an effort to develop a new way of thinking about it.\n\nOur new paper, published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications, argues there are five key ingredients needed to make leadership training worthwhile.\n\nSo, what do managers need to know before spending money and time on sending their staff off to leadership training?\n\nRead more:\n\n3 things we need to get right to ensure online professional development works\n\nEffective leaders are self-motivated learners. Basically, if the staff member isn't motivated, they won't learn. So there is no point in managers sending unwilling staff members off to leadership training.\n\nOur research suggests staff need to self-nominate for leadership development courses. Those who put their hand up to this kind of training will be intrinsically motivated learners.\n\nMany leadership courses give guidance on how to approach certain challenges at work, such as managing conflict or leading a change process.\n\nBut this guidance is of little value if the staff member doing the training can't practise their newfound skills.\n\nManagers need to ensure the skills staff members learn at training can be applied and practised. That means giving your staff the time, opportunities and support to use what they learned at leadership training.\n\nManagers need to give their staff who have done leadership training the opportunity to take on new challenges at work in a psychologically safe context (staff will also need their regular workload reduced so they can do this new work).\n\nFor example, the leadership program could run concurrently with a workplace change such as implementing a new system or process. The person doing the leadership training could be supported by their boss to take carriage of this implementation.\n\nEffective learning at work requires a combination of skills. These include:\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to treat leadership training not as a one-off but as part of a broader culture of learning at work.\n\nManagers can support this culture of learning this by, for example, having monthly meetings at which staff can talk openly and constructively about what's worked lately, what hasn't, and why. Managers can also ensure staff are given adequate training on new technologies, so they feel more confident about technological change at work.\n\nManagers may also want to find ways to offer different types of learning opportunities at work. Some staff members will thrive in a group work environment; others will prefer to study a manual themselves, watch an instructional video or do a short online course.\n\nIf managers cultivate a culture of continuous learning at work, it means that when staff go off to leadership training, they will be more able to absorb and apply the lessons.\n\nA crucial feature of leadership training is ensuring there is a high-quality facilitator.\n\nA good course facilitator doesn't just give a lecture and then answer questions. They also help participants find appropriate applied learning projects, help them learn self-reflection skills, and provide coaching and feedback.\n\nThey also play a crucial role in supporting individual and group learning.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to do some due diligence before sending staff off to a leadership training course.\n\nThat might involve reading reviews, getting feedback from people who have already done the course, and carefully checking the credentials of the facilitator.\n\nSuccessful organisations don't just have good individual leaders. They also need collective leadership. That means developing a culture at work that values:\n\nManagers can foster this culture of collective leadership at work by facilitating honest, safe conversations about innovation and change.\n\nIt means making all staff aware it's everyone's job to identify ways the organisation can improve, rather than just relying on one or two leaders.\n\nIt's crucial managers find leadership training courses that can embed this message into their training.\n\nChange is all around us, whether that's climate change, economic change or technological change with the development of AI. The workplaces that will survive and thrive in this era of rapid change are those that take skills development seriously.\n\nTreating leadership training as a box-ticking exercise won't cut it.

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Bitsconex.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Bitsconex.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Bitsconex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Bitsconex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Bitsconex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nBitsconex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Bitsconex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Bitsconex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Bitsconex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Bitsconex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nBitsconex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Bitsconex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Bitsconex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Bitsconex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Bitsconex.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Bitsconex.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table.\n\nWhat to Do If Scammed 😱\n\nIf you've fallen prey to the Bitsconex.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims. Here's a concise list of steps you should take right away:\n\n🛑 Stop All Deposits and Sharing of Personal Info\n\nCease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website.\n\n🏦 Contact Your Bank Immediately\n\nNotify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Bitsconex.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nConclusion: Watch Out for Traps Like Bitsconex.com 🛡️\n\nThe Bitsconex.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡","myantispyware.com","news","My AntiSpyware","","","","","https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitsconex.com-crypto-scam.jpg","null","-0.4117647058823529","447912755","9","","","",""

But remember, if something looks too good to be true, it likely is. Genuine investment opportunities come from reputable sources that you can verify, not random ads, obscure websites, or unsolicited messages. Be extremely cautious about where you invest your cryptocurrencies, especially if it's a platform or an individual you're unfamiliar with, and always prioritize your online security. Raising awareness of such scams is crucial to protect yourself in the digital finance space.\n\n🚨 Is Atcointrade.com a Scam?\n\nYes, the cryptocurrency trading and investment platform Atcointrade.com, which promises significant profits through digital asset trading, is a Scam! 🚫 If you've encountered promotions or been led to a website showcasing high returns on investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, exercise caution. These promises are deceptive and designed to lure you into a scheme that aims to take your money under false pretenses.\n\nThe website and its promotional materials may appear legitimate, displaying graphs and testimonials of successful trades and massive earnings. 🚨 The objective? To deceive you into depositing cryptocurrencies with the promise of incredible returns. However, attempts to withdraw funds are met with endless excuses, ultimately leading to the loss of your investment. Remember: genuine investment opportunities are transparent and come from credible sources. Always verify the legitimacy of investment platforms through reliable and independent reviews before committing.\n\n🚩 Red Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nBe vigilant and question the credibility of Atcointrade.com if you encounter these warning signs. 🔍🛡️\n\n🕵️♂️ How the Atcointrade.com Scam Works\n\nThe ""Atcointrade.com Scam"" is a sophisticated scheme that targets individuals interested in cryptocurrency investments, promising high returns but designed to defraud them. It's crucial to understand its operation to safeguard against falling victim to such scams. 💡🔐\n\n🚨 Initial Lure with High Returns\n\nThe scam begins with engaging advertisements on social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, or through direct messages, showcasing the potential for substantial profits from trading digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. These ads exploit the growing interest in cryptocurrency investments, drawing individuals to Atcointrade.com without much skepticism.\n\n🔗 Fabricated Profit Displays\n\nAtcointrade.com presents users with convincing yet entirely false records of trading successes, including:\n\nThese fabricated metrics are designed to convince visitors that they too can achieve similar financial successes by investing with the platform.\n\n🎭 Deposit Traps and Withdrawal Blocks\n\nVisitors are encouraged to make initial deposits in cryptocurrency to start trading and are shown fake account growth to motivate further investments. However, when attempts are made to withdraw funds, users are met with various excuses:\n\nThese tactics ensure that funds remain trapped within the platform, with no real possibility of withdrawal.\n\n📥 Escalation to Complete Blockade\n\nAs users become more insistent on withdrawing their funds or begin to question the legitimacy of the platform, Atcointrade.com's operators may escalate their tactics. This can include shutting down communication, threatening legal action under false pretenses, or even completely disappearing by taking the website offline and erasing all traces of their online presence.\n\n🔄 Illusion of Authenticity\n\nDespite the fraudulent nature, Atcointrade.com goes to great lengths to appear legitimate. The website features professional designs and sophisticated interfaces, creating an illusion of a genuine investment platform, which lowers the guard of potential investors.\n\n🕳️ Concealed Operations and Network Connections\n\nUpon closer inspection, Atcointrade.com shows typical signs of a scam operation. Direct access to the site may reveal inconsistencies, such as non-functional pages or sudden changes in content. The domain, often newly registered with hidden WHOIS information, is a common trait among fraudulent sites. Advanced tools might uncover that Atcointrade.com is part of a larger network of similar scam sites, suggesting a widespread, organized fraud operation.\n\nThe Atcointrade.com Crypto Scam is not an isolated incident. Digital fraudsters continually evolve their tactics and launch seemingly irresistible offers, aiming to exploit enthusiastic and unsuspecting participants. Here's a list of some recent, similar scams that have been making the rounds:\n\nMrBeast Bitcoin Promo Code Scam on TikTok\n\nThis scam involves fake profiles or posts on TikTok claiming to offer exclusive Bitcoin promo codes from popular YouTuber MrBeast. Users are enticed to enter these codes on scam websites, promising significant Bitcoin rewards. The catch often involves making an initial investment or providing personal information, leading to financial loss or identity theft. Remember, legitimate promotions from public figures like MrBeast will be well-documented across their official channels and platforms.\n\nScammers impersonate Elon Musk or SpaceX on various social media platforms, claiming to offer a crypto giveaway. They may use fake accounts or hacked profiles to appear credible, asking users to send a small amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet address to ""verify"" their account for a larger giveaway. This scam capitalizes on the high profile of Elon Musk and his associations with cryptocurrency, but any requirement to send funds for verification is a significant red flag.\n\nSimilar to the MrBeast Bitcoin scam, this scheme involves scammers claiming that MrBeast is dropping his own cryptocurrency token. Potential victims might encounter this scam through social media ads, direct messages, or email campaigns, urging them to invest early for high returns. The scammers might request transfers of existing crypto to participate or ask for personal details to register for the drop. It's essential to verify such claims directly through MrBeast's official channels before taking any action.\n\nIf you've fallen victim to the Atcointrade.com scam, it's crucial to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and protect your finances. Here's a comprehensive guide on the steps to take:\n\n🏦 Contact Your Financial Institution:\n\nReach out to your bank or any other financial service you used to send money to Atcointrade.com. Explain that the transaction was part of a scam. They might be able to halt the transaction or reverse it if it's not too late. In some cases, they may issue a chargeback. If you've shared your credit/debit card details, ask for a new card to prevent further unauthorized use. Keep a record of any financial losses as they can be crucial for investigations and potential reimbursement.\n\n🔐 Change Passwords:\n\nIf you've shared any passwords with Atcointrade.com or used the same passwords on other sites, change them immediately. This is particularly important for accounts associated with financial institutions or that contain sensitive personal information. Using a reliable password manager can help you maintain strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.\n\n👀 Monitor Your Accounts:\n\nClosely watch your financial statements for the following months. Look out for any transactions you didn't authorize, no matter how small they might seem. Unauthorized transactions could indicate that your account information is being used fraudulently. Consider signing up for a credit monitoring service that can alert you to changes in your credit report, which might suggest identity theft.\n\n🚔 Report the Scam:\n\nReport the scam to the appropriate authorities. This might include your local law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Providing them with detailed information and evidence about your experience can help with their investigations and might prevent others from being scammed.\n\n💻 Secure Your Devices:\n\nIf you've downloaded anything from Atcointrade.com or clicked on any links they provided, your computer or device may be compromised. Run a thorough antivirus scan to check for malware or spyware. If you're unsure how to do this or the scan finds something, you might need to seek help from a professional to clean your device.\n\n📘 Learn About Scams:\n\nEducate yourself on the tactics used in online scams like Atcointrade.com. Understanding how these scams work can help you avoid falling victim in the future. Keep up with news on recent scams and phishing methods by following reputable news sources and official government warnings.\n\n📢 Spread the Word:\n\nInform your friends and family about the Atcointrade.com scam, especially if they're interested in cryptocurrency investments. Sharing your experience can help prevent others from falling into the same trap. Awareness is a powerful tool against scammers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Atcointrade.com Scam is a sophisticated trap set by fraudsters. They lure you in with the promise of high returns on cryptocurrency investments, showcasing a professional-looking website filled with impressive, yet entirely fabricated, financial statistics. What's their real agenda? To convince you to deposit your digital assets into their platform, making you believe in the illusion of lucrative trading success. However, when you try to withdraw your supposed earnings, you're met with a barrage of excuses, effectively locking your funds on their platform. Instead of profiting, you're left dealing with the loss of your investment and a breach of your financial security.\n\nIt's critical to understand that genuine investment opportunities are usually associated with well-established and transparent entities, not obscure websites promising quick riches. The key to safeguarding yourself against such scams is to be vigilant and informed. If an investment opportunity seems excessively promising without any clear risk, it's likely a scam. Always verify the legitimacy of a platform before investing, be wary of sharing sensitive information online, and educate your friends and family about the dangers of such scams to prevent them from falling victim. Implementing strong cybersecurity measures like regular password updates and enabling two-factor authentication can also enhance your protection against online fraud. 🛡️🌐","myantispyware.com","news","My AntiSpyware","","","","","https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Atcointrade.com-WHOIS-Lookup.png","null","-0.0117647058823529","447912490","4","","","",""

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Bebspace.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Bebspace.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Bebspace.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Bebspace.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Bebspace.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nBebspace.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Bebspace.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Bebspace.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Bebspace.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Bebspace.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nBebspace.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Bebspace.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Bebspace.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Bebspace.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Bebspace.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Bebspace.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table.\n\nWhat to Do If Scammed 😱\n\nIf you've fallen prey to the Bebspace.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims. Here's a concise list of steps you should take right away:\n\n🛑 Stop All Deposits and Sharing of Personal Info\n\nCease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website.\n\n🏦 Contact Your Bank Immediately\n\nNotify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Bebspace.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nConclusion: Watch Out for Traps Like Bebspace.com 🛡️\n\nThe Bebspace.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡","myantispyware.com","news","My AntiSpyware","","","","","https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bebspace.com-crypto-scam.jpg","null","-0.4352941176470588","447912489","9","","","",""

""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nYou might be interested in\n\nBreaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969 Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press staff writers Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election","thestar.com","news","The Star","jill_colvin@thestar.com","Jill Colvin","author","False","https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/ee/9eeb75f2-ffde-5f85-9371-dbdd16cc1337/65ef4ee9ea74a.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize","eng-9380150","-0.02745098039215688","447912489","1","","","",""

This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it's all a deception.\n\nIn this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Bitenexer.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Bitenexer.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Bitenexer.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Bitenexer.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Bitenexer.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nBitenexer.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Bitenexer.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Bitenexer.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Bitenexer.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Bitenexer.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nBitenexer.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Bitenexer.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Bitenexer.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Bitenexer.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Bitenexer.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Bitenexer.com.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,"" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n""There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,"" Harkey said. ""That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.""\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n""Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.""\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's ""ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link"" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received ""marginal"" overall ratings.\n\n""We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,"" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise ""is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,"" not as a safety feature.\n\nDifferent assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received ""poor"" overall ratings, although all achieved ""good"" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n""This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,"" Mercedes said in a statement. ""We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.""\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved ""good"" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n""We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,"" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.

Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal.\n\n""If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,"" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot.\n\nTesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise.\n\nAnderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNEARLY 1,000 CRASHES\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use.\n\nThe agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts.\n\nThe fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving.\n\n""There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,"" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves.\n\nIt disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane.\n\nThe step-up ""enhanced"" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features.\n\nThe $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'READY TO TAKE CONTROL'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law.\n\nThe former Tesla president's message, he said, ""corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles"".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript.\n\nReuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behavior.\n\nAfter a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n""Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,"" he said.\n\n""It is not the neophytes.""\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions.\n\nAutopilot might make an ""unexpected steering input"" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver ""is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake"".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n""I'm not aware of any research specifically,"" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n""I cannot,"" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLULLED INTO DISTRACTION\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: ""Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.""\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n""The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,"" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman.\n\n""I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.""\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers ""adhere to their continuous driving responsibility"".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading U.S. product-testing companies.\n\nIts road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n""Autopilot usually does a good job,"" Funkhouser said.","fijitimes.com.fj","news","The Fiji Times","","","","","https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-11T155941Z_3_LYNXNPEK2A0CO_RTROPTP_4_TESLA-AUTOPILOT-LAWSUITS.jpg","null","-0.003921568627450966","447912368","1","","","",""

On February 29, the X boss took legal action against OpenAI and filed a lawsuit against the Sam Altman-led company. In the lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of abandoning its original mission and breaching its founding agreement. Now, OpenAI has sent a legal response to the lawsuit, denying the existence of any agreement and saying that Musk just wants all the success for himself.\n\nThis is the first legal response from OpenAI concerning the lawsuit. According to a report in The Verge, the company, in a court filing, has said that there was no founding agreement with Musk at all and that it is all ""fictional"".\n\n""There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear. The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him,"" the lawsuit states.\n\nIn addition to this, OpenAI, in the filing, also said that Musk ""dropped OpenAI"" when his wishes were not following and looking at OpenAI's technological advancements, he wants ""all success for himself.""\n\n""Were this case to proceed to discovery, the evidence would show that Musk supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI, to be controlled by Musk himself, and dropped the project when his wishes were not followed. Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,' the lawsuit states.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the situation, Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman's OpenAI last week, alleging contract breaches and unfair business practices. Musk claimed that OpenAI's shift towards maximizing profits for Microsoft, rather than serving humanity, contradicted the company's original mission.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Altman had shared an old conversation on X where he supported Musk during a challenging period for Tesla in 2019. A couple of days later, OpenAI had published a blog post containing Musk's past emails to the company's founders, showcasing his previous endorsement of OpenAI's for-profit arm and suggesting a potential merger with Tesla.\n\nIn their blog post, OpenAI also expressed sadness regarding the current state of affairs with Musk.\n\nThe post read, ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired -- someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him.""","indiatoday.in","news","India Today","","","","","https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202403/openai-ceo-sam-altman-and-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-014253852-16x9_3.jpg?VersionId=eK_YInyPZg6O6FXqz0pErR7QUQtbsLzN","eng-9383543","0.2156862745098038","447911994","6","","","",""

The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election.

The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.","wfae.org","news","WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source","","","","","https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ddef2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1726x971+0+378/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Fap24071617990627_sq-ed768c4b296161006592759585febb50f8086b3f.jpg","null","0.01960784313725483","447911231","1","","","",""

Those few months he spent in Berlin next to Winston became critical in for humanity in aspect of what corruption can and does to a human being as well as to humanity.\n\nBritons rejected neonazi paedo crown during WW2, but once war was over - even men like Winston Churchill returned to their knees infront of deadly curruption and those who didn't, suffered same faith as to the one George Patton himself have.\n\nGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov who walked on blood of his soldiers, HAVE IN ULTIMATE MOMENT FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE(was so corrupt that he failed to even acknowledge deaths of his fellow men) FACT THAT WW2 VICTORY FROM SOVIET STANCE WAS A VICTORY OF PEOPLE AND NOT INDCASE DIFFERENT FROM INDIVIDUAL(THATS ALSO WHAT MAKES MY CASE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ZHUKOV - I AM IN SITUATION BECAUSE OF TOTAL BETRAYAL OF PEOPLE AGAINST HUMANITY DUE TO BIGGEST CORRUPTION EVER ON A SUPER MASS SCALE) AS WAS AND IS MY CASE - INDIFFERENT FROM THE ONE AGAINST PARASITIC RUSSIAN TSARIST VAMPIRES. His treasures which were confiscated by Soviet Union WERE WELL DESERVED CONFISCATED. AND UNLIKE CASE WAS WITH OTHER GENERALS/OFFICERS WHOM, SOVIET UNION ALLOWED ZHUKOV TO PUBLISH\n\nHIS MEMOIRS WHICH WAS FOR THOSE TIMES UNHEARD OFF. THERE IS 15 MILLION BRITONS THAT DROWN AT THIS MOMENT IN POVERTY AND DO SO TO SATISFY PRIVATE POCKETS OF THOSE WHOM THEY SHOULD GET RID OF IT ALREADY LONG LONG AGO.\n\nBritish are extremely Valenti nation, but in eyes of curruption totally worthless. British won war against nazism during WW2 and pushed paedo crown on outer limits of existence during one(HAD TO KEEP ITS NEONAZI MOUTHS SHUT OR OTHERWISE), but bent on knees infront of one as soon as war ended. Soviet Union never would made through without British and American support during WW2 and nor without so much hated Joseph Stalin who despite all for times during which Soviet military was still in development, did whatever was necessary for country to survive - including execution of some 40.000 officers we see have RETAKEN(same spirit of traitors) control of Russia in its war on people of Ukraine. While I met remnants of Zhukov's family, please do not compare me with one. I have exactly ZERO SIMILARITIES WITH ZHUKOV CALIBERS and don' see myself in absolutely anything in one other than victory he managed to execute on behalf of Soviet people. Zhukov according to my views also became lazy and incompetent loosing waste amounts of people - didn't bother to personally ensure battlefields via horse riding or walking to also keep up in shape prior to operations.\n\nExceptionalism(EGOISM IN CASE OF ZHUKOV - NEVER IN MINE SINCE I WAS STOLEN GIFTS YOU SEE SHUKOV RECEIVED SINCE MY AGE 9 MONTHS ALL STORED IN BELGRADE WAS TOLD AND WHAT I ALSO DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OTHER THAN ADMISSIONS INTO CRIME BY SLOVENIAN AND SERBIAN CHETNIKS IN HONOR TO HUMAN DIGNITY - ROBBED OF LIFE BY TITO AND SO CALLED YUGOSLAVS - PRIMARILY SLOVENES/SERBS AND EVEN CROATS) always was and will remain a mean PAEDO CROWN's weapon of choice - revelation of curruption whichever society they aim at for its divide and conquer plans is indifferent from so called exceptionalism. Never forget about who you are/your background and don't shy from costs you ancestry paid for you to be alive - something paedo crown members never had to deal with. Putin used me with\n\nMedvedev to utterly resale confiscated neonazi memorabilia to West via Zhukov and Stalin's issue after penetrating in absolutely every pore of the Russian society while British paedo crown through the case of Zhukov and similar utterly aimed at uncovering names of executors of Russian bloodsuckers/parasites(ROMANOVS WHO SUCKED BLOOD OF CHILDREN AS WORKFORCE IN MOST BRUTAL HUMAN CONDITIONS - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ALL TAKEN OFF FROM INTERNET BY MEDVEDEV AND PUTIN) in desperate attempt to obviously somehow retaliate.\n\nGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov's relatives involved in so called MK Ultra cried British paedo cabal in front of Putin about being robbed of his possessions on which one personally spent money while in Germany, but I WOULD HAND TREASONOUS SCUM IN MOSCOW SQUARE TOGETHER WITH PUTIN AND MEDVEDEV FOR NATION TO REMEMBER ITS HUMBLE NON PARASITIC(finally non Romanov's) BEGINNINGS WHICH LED INTO SURVIVAL OF WW2 WHICH THEY NEVER EVER WOULD WITH ROMANOVS. BRITISH MANAGED TO DEFEAT/CONQUER ADOLF HITLER DURING WW2, BUT THEY NEVER MANAGED TO LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM PEST THAT HUNTED ENTIRE HUMANITY SINCE DAY 1 AND BUILT ITS WEALTH THROUGH MOST BLOODSUCKING PARASITIC COLLECTIONS(death via total exploitation - and what became death worse even than through human slavery itself) OF LIVES.\n\nDON'T COMPARE ME AND VALUE ME ACCORDINGLY WITH WHITE GUARDS TRASH - OR INTERNATIONAL JEWRY USED AS ESPIONAGE NETWORK BY LONDON/WASHINGTON DC / TEL AVAIV https://ausertimes.blogspot.com/2024/02/about-coming-nuclear-war-as-planned-on_22.html THEY WERE ALL INTERESTED IN SAME THING - GAINING POWER THROUGH GENOCIDE/EXTERMINATION PROCEDURE AND/OR TI CAUSE AS MUCH AS PHYSICAL HARM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE RESOLVING POSTAL PSYCHIATRIC CRIME.

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor.

And along the way, they amassed staggering fortunes that have disconnected them from reality.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who broke into a sweat during an on-stage interview with Swisher in 2010, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who once talked to her regularly before cutting off communications after he bought Twitter in 2022, are painted in the harshest light.\n\n""If Mark Zuckerberg is the most damaging man in tech to me, Musk was the most disappointing,"" Swisher writes in her 300-page book.\n\nThat's one of the milder critiques in what's a mostly scathing takedown by one of the most respected and feared reporters covering technology. Her reputation is such that Swisher has become as synonymous with Silicon Valley as the famous entrepreneurs who shaped it since she began covering the industry in the 1990s.\n\nCEOs, including Zuckerberg and Musk, regularly granted her exclusive interviews, fed her scoops and sometimes even secretly called her for advice, according to her book. When the HBO series, ""Silicon Valley,"" needed someone to play an influential reporter in an episode, Swisher was cast as herself - a role she still regularly fills as a technology commentator on major TV networks.\n\nSwisher no longer resides in Silicon Valley. She moved to Washington, D.C., a few years ago, mostly because that's where her wife works, but also because she was feeling a need to escape what had become an increasingly toxic and insular scene.\n\nBut she has remained plugged into - and worried - about what is happening with technology, particularly with the accelerating rise of artificial intelligence and its potential for causing even more damage than she thinks has already been done by social media, smartphones and other products that haven't been tightly regulated.\n\nSwisher told The Associated Press that she hopes ""Burn Book"" serves as shot across the bow of both the technology industry and governments around the world, a warning that the same missteps that happened during the past 20 years must not be repeated as artificial intelligence seeps into all corners of society.\n\n""Don't get fooled a second time,"" Swisher said of what she hopes the book's main takeaway will be. ""We need our government to make these (technology-industry) people accountable and that has not happened. We need them to understand consequences because they certainly haven't done us right on the damaging parts of technology. We need to stop letting them off the hook.""\n\nSwisher initially didn't even want to write another book, partly because she has become more interested in focusing on her Pivot podcast. But she but finally got on a roll after she hired Nell Scovell, who co-wrote a best-selling book with former Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, to help her remember all the stories she accumulated.\n\nThose recollections led her to disassemble some of the world's richest people in her book, but Swisher isn't worried about the blowback.\n\n""I don't care what they think,"" Swisher said. ""The worst thing I do is tell people what I think of them, but I am being truthful.""\n\nMusk, who also runs rocket ship maker SpaceX and social media company X, used a pejorative term for anus to describe Swisher in his last email sent to her in October 2022, according to her book.\n\n""You can see it every day on Twitter (renamed X by Musk), there is something wrong with him,"" Swisher said of Musk during the AP interview. ""He is in desperate need of attention, he is a classic narcissist who has turned into a malevolent narcissist.""\n\nSwisher doesn't spend her entire book bashing tech leaders. She devotes an entire chapter to the industry's ""mensches,"" a list that includes Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, investor Mark Cuban and the late Dave Goldberg, who was CEO of SurveyMonkey and Sandberg's husband when he died in 2015 while on vacation in Mexico. She also has mostly kind words for the likes of former Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Apple CEO Tim Cook and his late predecessor, Steve Jobs.\n\nEventually, Swisher said she hopes she will look back kindly on the tech leaders at the vanguard of AI, especially Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the San Francisco startup behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\n""One thing I do like about Sam is he is able to hold two conflicting ideas in his head at the same time,"" Swisher said. ""Of course, he is going to be a techno-optimist, but he is not a techno-idiot. Now what will be a problem is he just takes whatever he wants, even though he has warned of unsafe things, and then does nothing about them. That's what too many of these tech moguls have done.""","rep-am.com","news","Republican American","bill_o_brien@rep-am.com","Bill O'Brien","author","False","https://cdn.rep-am.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240311-230450-pic-150315200.jpg","null","-0.2470588235294118","447910928","1","","","",""

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.","bpr.org","news","bpr.org","","","","","https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ddef2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1726x971+0+378/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Fap24071617990627_sq-ed768c4b296161006592759585febb50f8086b3f.jpg","null","0.01960784313725483","447910818","1","","","",""

Good leadership training needs these 5 ingredients","Torrens University Australia provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU.\n\nMany of us have done leadership training for work, come back to the office and thought: ""That was a huge waste of time"". Or returned with the best of intentions but realised, six months on, we never actually used any of skills we learned on the course.\n\nSo, what makes leadership development programs effective?\n\nWe spent months researching leadership and management courses, in an effort to develop a new way of thinking about it.\n\nOur new paper, published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications, argues there are five key ingredients needed to make leadership training worthwhile.\n\nSo, what do managers need to know before spending money and time on sending their staff off to leadership training?\n\nRead more: 3 things we need to get right to ensure online professional development works\n\n1. The employee must want to be there\n\nEffective leaders are self-motivated learners. Basically, if the staff member isn't motivated, they won't learn. So there is no point in managers sending unwilling staff members off to leadership training.\n\nOur research suggests staff need to self-nominate for leadership development courses. Those who put their hand up to this kind of training will be intrinsically motivated learners.\n\n2. Managers need to let staff use their new leadership skills at work\n\nMany leadership courses give guidance on how to approach certain challenges at work, such as managing conflict or leading a change process.\n\nBut this guidance is of little value if the staff member doing the training can't practise their newfound skills.\n\nManagers need to ensure the skills staff members learn at training can be applied and practised. That means giving your staff the time, opportunities and support to use what they learned at leadership training.\n\nManagers need to give their staff who have done leadership training the opportunity to take on new challenges at work in a psychologically safe context (staff will also need their regular workload reduced so they can do this new work).\n\nFor example, the leadership program could run concurrently with a workplace change such as implementing a new system or process. The person doing the leadership training could be supported by their boss to take carriage of this implementation.\n\n3. Managers need to cultivate a continuous learning mindset\n\nEffective learning at work requires a combination of skills. These include:\n\nself-awareness about one's learning style\n\nbeing open to new learning methods and technologies\n\nbeing able to change the way you do things at work when new opportunities arise\n\nbeing able to regularly reflect on learning experiences, successes and failures.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to treat leadership training not as a one-off but as part of a broader culture of learning at work.\n\nManagers can support this culture of learning this by, for example, having monthly meetings at which staff can talk openly and constructively about what's worked lately, what hasn't, and why. Managers can also ensure staff are given adequate training on new technologies, so they feel more confident about technological change at work.\n\nManagers may also want to find ways to offer different types of learning opportunities at work. Some staff members will thrive in a group work environment; others will prefer to study a manual themselves, watch an instructional video or do a short online course.\n\nIf managers cultivate a culture of continuous learning at work, it means that when staff go off to leadership training, they will be more able to absorb and apply the lessons.\n\n4. Managers need to ensure training is delivered by good facilitators\n\nA crucial feature of leadership training is ensuring there is a high-quality facilitator.\n\nA good course facilitator doesn't just give a lecture and then answer questions. They also help participants find appropriate applied learning projects, help them learn self-reflection skills, and provide coaching and feedback.\n\nThey also play a crucial role in supporting individual and group learning.\n\nIn practice, this means managers need to do some due diligence before sending staff off to a leadership training course.\n\nThat might involve reading reviews, getting feedback from people who have already done the course, and carefully checking the credentials of the facilitator.\n\n5. Organisations need both individual leaders and collective leadership\n\nSuccessful organisations don't just have good individual leaders. They also need collective leadership. That means developing a culture at work that values:\n\nlearning\n\ninnovation\n\nbeing adaptable\n\nbeing able to deal with continuous change.\n\nManagers can foster this culture of collective leadership at work by facilitating honest, safe conversations about innovation and change.\n\nIt means making all staff aware it's everyone's job to identify ways the organisation can improve, rather than just relying on one or two leaders.\n\nIt's crucial managers find leadership training courses that can embed this message into their training.\n\nChange is all around us, whether that's climate change, economic change or technological change with the development of AI. The workplaces that will survive and thrive in this era of rapid change are those that take skills development seriously.\n\nTreating leadership training as a box-ticking exercise won't cut it. Good leadership training is crucial to developing good leadership, but managers need to make sure the course is actually worth it in the first place.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk's 'hardcore' management style: a case study in what not to do","theconversation.com","news","The Conversation","","","","","https://images.theconversation.com/files/540320/original/file-20230801-231213-d9k81i.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=48%2C243%2C5421%2C2710&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","null","0.1215686274509804","447910746","1","","","",""

Peter Chen envisions RFM-1 as a revolutionary solution capable of propelling billions of robots into various sectors, emphasizing the need for adaptable systems.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, the platform's launch aligns with ongoing discussions in the robotics industry regarding the future of ""general-purpose"" systems, particularly with the emergence of humanoid robotics firms. Covariant's software, currently deployed on industrial robotic arms for tasks like bin picking, exhibits hardware agnosticism, promising compatibility with various robotic systems.\n\nRFM-1 is heralded for providing robots with a ""human-like ability to reason,"" a departure from traditional robotic systems programmed for repetitive tasks. In contrast to single-purpose robots, RFM-1 processes real-world data, determining optimal actions based on a deeper understanding of language and the physical world. The platform's interface allows users to input text commands, fostering natural interactions with robots.\n\nCovariant aims to bridge the gap between traditional programming and a more intuitive method for human-robot interaction, promoting efficiency and adaptability. While the claims of a ""human-like ability to reason"" warrant careful consideration, Covariant's RFM-1 showcases a new paradigm in robot decision-making, with potential applications revolutionizing training, programming, and deployment across various industries.\n\nTechTimes earlier reported that Tech mogul Jeff Bezos, along with major players like Nvidia Corp., spearheaded investments in Figure AI Inc., a Sunnyvale-based startup focused on humanoid robot development.\n\nAmid a funding round targeting around $675 million, with an estimated pre-money valuation of $2 billion, Jeff Bezos commits $100 million through Explore Investments LLC. Microsoft invests $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon-affiliated fund contribute $50 million each.\n\nLast year, Parkway Venture Capital led the $70 million initial external funding round for Figure AI, which also included $20 million from the company's CEO and founder Brett Adcock. The ongoing funding round includes investments from Intel Corp.'s venture capital arm, LG Innotek, Samsung's investment group, Parkway Venture Capital, Align Ventures, ARK Venture Fund, Aliya Capital Partners, Tamarack, Boscolo Intervest Ltd., and BOLD Capital Partners.\n\nWhile the final details of the funding round are pending confirmation, these substantial investments underscore the increasing interest in the AI robotics sector. Figure AI focuses on advancing AI technology, concentrating on creating humanoid robots capable of functioning in diverse environments, such as warehouses and retail spaces, and handling hazardous tasks, with support from OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe broader AI robotics industry witnesses significant activity, with companies like 1X Technologies AS and Sanctuary AI securing substantial funds for humanoid robot development. Elon Musk, the company's CEO, is actively developing the humanoid robot Optimus in anticipation of a billion humanoid robots populating the planet by the 2040s, thanks to the expanding potential of AI-powered software to improve robot-human interaction and collaboration.","techtimes.com","news","Tech Times","quincy_jon@techtimes.com","Quincy Jon","author","False","https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/444579/820/0/0/0/covariant.jpg","null","0.3019607843137255","447910636","1","","","",""

OpenAI reacted to Musk's complaint last week by deriding it in a memo to employees and releasing emails involving him that go back to its earliest days.\n\nMusk, who claimed breach of contract at the startup that he backed, referred in his complaint earlier this month to a 2015 ""founding agreement"" with him and two other OpenAI co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. The three were agreeing that a new AI lab would be a nonprofit for the benefit of humanity and that it would not keep information private for commercial benefit, Musk said.\n\nHe went on to say that in releasing the GPT-4 large language model last year without providing scientific details for public consumption, OpenAI breached that agreement.\n\n""There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear,"" OpenAI said in a document on file with California's superior court for San Francisco County. ""The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him.""\n\nMusk quoted OpenAI's 2015 certificate of incorporation with the Delaware secretary of state, asserting that it ""memorialized"" the founding agreement. But OpenAI responded by saying that Musk's complaint lacked an actual agreement.\n\nThe Microsoft-backed startup called Musk's claims frivolous. But in a Monday blog post it said it was asking the court to designate the case as complex and obtain dedicated case management for it, because it involves AI and its claims go back almost 10 years.\n\nIn his complaint, Musk mentioned that, regarding OpenAI's 2017 plan to establish a for-profit organization, he told Brockman, Altman and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever to ""[e]ither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit.""\n\nOpenAI said in its filing, dated March 6, that if the case were to go to discovery, evidence would show that Musk was on board with the startup gaining for-profit structure.\n\nMusk has his own AI lab called X.AI, which has released a chatbot called Grok that's available through X, formerly known as Twitter, which Musk acquired in 2022. The startup will release Grok's code under an open-source license this week, Musk said in an X post on Monday.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT had 100 million weekly users as of November.\n\n""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" OpenAI said in its filing. ""So he brings this action accusing Defendants of breaching a contract that never existed and duties Musk was never owed, demanding relief calculated to benefit a competitor to OpenAI.""","nbcsandiego.com","news","NBC 7 San Diego","","","","","https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/03/107385929-1710201072107-gettyimages-1852466661-ITALY_MUSK.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","null","0.2078431372549019","447910317","1","","","",""

Recent years have seen Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and most attention-grabbing Elon Musk raise voices rightwards. Valley conservatism is no longer in the closet. But when one boils labels down to essentials, they amount to much less than their sound and fury.\n\nUS says hello, global talent | Silicon Valley's greatness is how it has remained the marquee hub for global tech innovation last century into this one. This has taken a trifecta of supportive govt policies, splendid access to venture capital, and top R&D at public universities plus private sector labs. On top of this, the real magic sauce has been a remarkable concentration of talented individuals attracted from across the world.\n\nChina says, stay away | That Google, LinkedIn, Tesla and Nvidia have all been co-founded by immigrants is where America leaves China far behind. Even the huge domestic labour supply that used to provide a counterweight, has begun to shrink. A logical way to deal with its rapid aging is for China to open up to those who are not ""descendents of the dragon"". To overcome prejudices around racial purity. There are no signs that it is ready for this mindset shift. In America, by contrast, no matter how much political heat immigration attracts, it continues apace, continuously adding to its labour force and economic growth.\n\nCan India pull world talent too? | Unlike China, India's labour supply is still expanding.

And along the way, they amassed staggering fortunes that have disconnected them from reality.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who broke into a sweat during an on-stage interview with Swisher in 2010, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who once talked to her regularly before cutting off communications after he bought Twitter in 2022, are painted in the harshest light.\n\n""If Mark Zuckerberg is the most damaging man in tech to me, Musk was the most disappointing,"" Swisher writes in her 300-page book.\n\nThat's one of the milder critiques in what's a mostly scathing takedown by one of the most respected and feared reporters covering technology. Her reputation is such that Swisher has become as synonymous with Silicon Valley as the famous entrepreneurs who shaped it since she began covering the industry in the 1990s.\n\nCEOs, including Zuckerberg and Musk, regularly granted her exclusive interviews, fed her scoops and sometimes even secretly called her for advice, according to her book. When the HBO series, ""Silicon Valley,"" needed someone to play an influential reporter in an episode, Swisher was cast as herself - a role she still regularly fills as a technology commentator on major TV networks.\n\nSwisher no longer resides in Silicon Valley. She moved to Washington, D.C., a few years ago, mostly because that's where her wife works, but also because she was feeling a need to escape what had become an increasingly toxic and insular scene.\n\nBut she has remained plugged into - and worried - about what is happening with technology, particularly with the accelerating rise of artificial intelligence and its potential for causing even more damage than she thinks has already been done by social media, smartphones and other products that haven't been tightly regulated.\n\nSwisher told The Associated Press that she hopes ""Burn Book"" serves as shot across the bow of both the technology industry and governments around the world, a warning that the same missteps that happened during the past 20 years must not be repeated as artificial intelligence seeps into all corners of society.\n\n""Don't get fooled a second time,"" Swisher said of what she hopes the book's main takeaway will be. ""We need our government to make these (technology-industry) people accountable and that has not happened. We need them to understand consequences because they certainly haven't done us right on the damaging parts of technology. We need to stop letting them off the hook.""\n\nSwisher initially didn't even want to write another book, partly because she has become more interested in focusing on her Pivot podcast. But she but finally got on a roll after she hired Nell Scovell, who co-wrote a best-selling book with former Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, to help her remember all the stories she accumulated.\n\nThose recollections led her to disassemble some of the world's richest people in her book, but Swisher isn't worried about the blowback.\n\n""I don't care what they think,"" Swisher said. ""The worst thing I do is tell people what I think of them, but I am being truthful.""\n\nMusk, who also runs rocket ship maker SpaceX and social media company X, used a pejorative term for anus to describe Swisher in his last email sent to her in October 2022, according to her book.\n\n""You can see it every day on Twitter (renamed X by Musk), there is something wrong with him,"" Swisher said of Musk during the AP interview. ""He is in desperate need of attention, he is a classic narcissist who has turned into a malevolent narcissist.""\n\nSwisher doesn't spend her entire book bashing tech leaders. She devotes an entire chapter to the industry's ""mensches,"" a list that includes Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, investor Mark Cuban and the late Dave Goldberg, who was CEO of SurveyMonkey and Sandberg's husband when he died in 2015 while on vacation in Mexico. She also has mostly kind words for the likes of former Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Apple CEO Tim Cook and his late predecessor, Steve Jobs.\n\nEventually, Swisher said she hopes she will look back kindly on the tech leaders at the vanguard of AI, especially Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the San Francisco startup behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\n""One thing I do like about Sam is he is able to hold two conflicting ideas in his head at the same time,"" Swisher said. ""Of course, he is going to be a techno-optimist, but he is not a techno-idiot. Now what will be a problem is he just takes whatever he wants, even though he has warned of unsafe things, and then does nothing about them. That's what too many of these tech moguls have done.""","rep-am.com","news","Republican American","bill_o_brien@rep-am.com","Bill O'Brien","author","False","https://cdn.rep-am.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240311-230450-pic-150315200.jpg","null","-0.2470588235294118","447909327","1","","","",""

Through this feature, users are given a 'rider rating' that determines their usage and tracks their impact individually, also using this to nudge customers in the right direction and make more impactful choices in their rides.\n\nDespite lowering an individual's emission rate when using Uber, users may still contribute to pollution unless they opt for EVs in their rides for an almost zero-emission experience.\n\nIn a new press release by Uber, the company introduced the new Emission Savings feature on the app, one that promotes a ""low-emissions lifestyle"" to help make them mindful of their environmental impact. Being mindful of one's surroundings is only a part of this green lifestyle, as users also need to start within themselves to effect this philosophy.\n\nThis feature is made available globally, and it will tell a person how much carbon footprint they contributed with their rides but also focus on the positive impact they have with the use of Uber.\n\nUber will preview several metrics like 'Estimated CO2 savings,' 'Your positive impact,' 'Your eco-friendly rides,' and more.\n\nRead Also: Uber Increases In-App Ads, Prompting Mixed Reactions from Customers\n\nUber said that this feature is similar to the rider rating feature, and this is because this will show how much they helped the environment and reduced carbon footprint through their choice of ride, may it be Uber Green or Uber Comfort Electric.\n\nThe app would also help calculate their emission savings based on the length of their ride and miles traveled. The company also makes this available for teen account holders, rolling out to select cities in the US and Canada.\n\nWhile it is known that Uber is not a car manufacturer, the ride-hailing app still deploys cars with internal combustion engines or hybrids which are still contributors to greenhouse gases and such. However, there were several investments made by Uber, and mostly partnerships, to center on clean energy ventures, with one being its collaboration with Waymo, known for its exclusive use of the Jaguar I-PACE EVs.\n\nAs part of Uber's Climate Pledge for 2040, the company is already investing heavily in clean energy vehicles, centering on its recent partnership for its fleet. The company chose KIA and its PV5 modular electric car for its ride-hailing service, encouraging its drivers to make the switch and use these EVs for their everyday duties in bringing users from point A to B.\n\nAdditionally, Uber also recently partnered up with Elon Musk's Tesla for this massive push towards electrified transportation, relying on its EVs for the service it will render the users.\n\nUber wants you to be conscious of your transportation, especially for its ride-hailing service, offering this Emission Savings feature that offers useful metrics that communicate the carbon footprint caused by one's use of the app's transportation method.","techtimes.com","news","Tech Times","isaiah_richard@techtimes.com","Isaiah Richard","author","False","https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/444580/820/0/0/0/uber-emission-savings.png","eng-9382292","0.223529411764706","447908285","1","","","",""

So will they really be free of the grim side-effects which mean so many give up within a year or two? - Today Headline","Tempted to try Ozempic or Wegovy? These weight-loss wonder drugs are riding a tidal wave of popularity, helped no doubt by celebrity endorsements, with seemingly everyone from Sharon Osbourne to Elon Musk reportedly benefiting from the weekly jabs.\n\nBut both may soon seem old hat, with new drugs around the corner that promise greater weight loss, come in more convenient forms or actually burn off fat while we go about our daily business without even noticing the medications at work -- or suffering side-effects.\n\nLast month both Superdrug and pharmacy service provider Pharmadoctor began privately offering a new weight-loss injection called Mounjaro (generic name tirzepatide), after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nNew drugs are promising greater weight loss than Ozempic and Wegovy. Last month, high street stores and pharmacy service providers started offering new weight-loss injection called Mounjaro... and three other alternatives are now in the pipeline\n\nOther emerging products that may soon become household names are Rybelsus, retatrutide and orforglipron.\n\nAll of these weight-loss drugs work by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone made naturally in the body that helps slow the passage of food through the stomach -- which makes people feel less hungry -- and alters the brain's appetite regulation, so that people feel satiated despite eating less; they also don't experience cravings for treat foods.\n\nRybelsus contains semaglutide, the same drug as in Wegovy and Ozempic (which is a lower dose, originally approved for treating type 2 diabetes), but in daily pill form rather than weekly jab. Similarly, orforglipron is a GLP-1 drug taken daily as a pill.\n\nRetatrutide, given as a weekly injection, is another drug that mimics GLP-1 but it also targets two other hunger hormones, GIP and glucagon.\n\nIn early-stage trials, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, obese people taking retatrutide lost almost a quarter of their body weight in 48 weeks -- outperforming Wegovy, which studies suggest help people to lose an average of 16 per cent of their body weight a year, and even Mounjaro, which may promote 25 per cent body weight loss a year.\n\nOzempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, is already preparing to hit back with another new drug, amycretin. This targets GLP-1 as well as another hormone, called amylin, which also reduces hunger and slows stomach emptying. Early results from the drug's safety trial suggest that amycretin can help users shed weight twice as quickly as Ozempic.\n\nAlso on the horizon are two different new classes of drugs, called controlled metabolic accelerators and thyromimetics. These speed the rate at which we burn up calories -- and thus lose fat (but more on these later).\n\nIt's not difficult to understand why drug companies are pouring into this field. Analysts at Barclays forecast that sales of weight-loss drugs will top £19billion globally this year, with the market growing to £110billion by 2030.\n\nOzempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, is preparing to release anew drug, amycretin. Early results from the drug's safety trial suggest it can help users shed weight twice as quickly as Ozempic\n\nBut the need for something 'better' than GLP-1 drugs has emerged as more and more people try them, because when medications are widely used, significant side-effect problems may fully emerge.\n\nIndeed, mounting evidence suggests that in the real world, the drugs' side-effects such as vomiting and diarrhoea are proving so common and overwhelming that it makes the current versions impractical for most patients to stay on for very long.\n\nThe result is very high patient drop-out rates in real life because of side-effects. As well as vomiting and diarrhoea, the most common adverse effects are nausea, constipation and tiredness.\n\nLess common complications of GLP-1 medications are gallstones, increased heart rate, kidney damage and pancreatitis -- a condition where the pancreas rapidly becomes painfully inflamed.\n\nAnother serious concern is gastroparesis, a severe disorder where the stomach muscles become effectively paralysed and the stomach does not empty, and sufferers vomit days-old food. For some patients, the only remedy for gastroparesis may be a gastric bypass. Around 10,000 patients in the U.S. are now suing Ozempic's maker, Novo Nordisk, and Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, for medical-injury damages.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it believed the claims are without merit; Eli Lilly said it will 'vigorously defend against these claims'.\n\nDespite side-effects now coming to light, there were no apparent high drop-out rates among patients using GLP-1 drugs in clinical trials, which were funded by the drugs' makers. Novo Nordisk reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year how its trial of 17,000 people taking semaglutide found that intolerable side-effects caused only one in six patients to stop taking it. But in the real world of patients taking GLP-1 drugs outside of carefully controlled clinical trials, the drop-out figures are significantly higher.\n\nFor example, a study in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care in 2022, which looked at health records of 589 Britons who had been prescribed GLP-1 medications for type 2 diabetes, reported the patient drop-out rates were 45 per cent after one year and 65 per cent at two years.\n\nThe researchers, funded by the drugs giant Merck (which is developing its own GLP-1 drug, efinopegdutide), warned that their study results 'suggest the real-world benefit of these agents on weight loss may be lower than that observed in clinical trials'.\n\nWorse drop-out rates were revealed in July last year by U.S. analysts, Prime Therapeutics. In an analysis of data from over 4,000 people prescribed GLP-1 drugs, it found that more than two-thirds of patients stopped taking them within a year.\n\nOnce a patient drops out of the regimen, most of their weight returns, along with related risks for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, chronic body-wide inflammation and problems with insulin control, according to another study, by Aintree University Hospital in 2022.\n\nAround 10,000 patients in the U.S. are now suing Novo Nordisk which makes Ozempic, pictured, and Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, for medical-injury damages\n\nThe researchers studied around 1,900 people who had received GLP-1 injections for more than a year and found that 12 months after they stopped the therapy, they had regained on average two-thirds of whatever weight they'd lost while on the drug.\n\nMeanwhile, longer-term side-effects are also emerging. One concern is muscle loss: trials of GLP-1 drugs show roughly 40 per cent of the weight lost is muscle mass rather than fat.\n\nThis can have serious health implications. Not only do you need muscle to burn calories but, for example, in middle-aged and older people, muscle loss (called sarcopenia) is strongly associated with frailty and early death.\n\nEli Lilly is collaborating with a California-based biotech firm, BioAge Labs, to develop a compound called azelaprag that may preserve muscle.\n\nThis drug mimics apelin, a hormone released during exercise that improves muscle function. It needs to pass safety and effectiveness trials in humans, so would not be available for some years.\n\nBut in the meantime, such is the concern about side-effects that in January, Eli Lilly published an open letter urging people not to use Mounjaro for cosmetic weight loss, and instead to take it only for serious medical needs such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt warned that 'Mounjaro should only be used when prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional', and said that it 'may cause tumours in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer', and 'serious side-effects, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)'.\n\nNaveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, told Good Health that he believes some of the side-effects occur because patients aren't changing their lifestyles to accommodate the GLP-1 medications.\n\n'If you're taking a drug that suppresses your appetite and slows the pace at which your stomach empties, then it's going to make you eat less and more slowly, and also to eat less foods that irritate the stomach such as spicy and fatty ones,' he says.\n\n'If people don't accordingly change their habits quickly enough, they'll have problems.'\n\nWe know that compliance is very low with people taking any drug long-term, even when it's for something serious such as diabetes or cancer\n\nProfessor Sattar, who has consulted for several companies that make weight-loss drugs, stresses: 'Some people can quickly make changes and significantly mitigate their risk of side-effects, by doing things such as slowly eating portions that are smaller and low in fat, and stopping eating when they feel satiated.'\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that others will suffer problems through adverse physical reactions to the medication.\n\n'It may be that some individuals' stomach tissue is hypersensitive to the drugs, so they will naturally have a problem,' he says.\n\n'But with an increasing range of GLP-1 drugs coming on to the market, I think people will find that if one medication doesn't work, another will.\n\n'All the time, doctors and patients are learning how to use these drugs better, so I think we will see the incidence of side-effects reducing significantly.'\n\nOthers are not so convinced.\n\nAs Ahmed Ahmed, a consultant bariatric surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London, says: 'Unrealistic expectations of a weight-loss cure have been driven by social media, not science or medicine, and by marketing rather than public health.\n\n'This has created some serious misconceptions: these drugs can certainly work, but clinical trials show that around a third of people don't respond to GLP-1 drugs [see case study, right].\n\n'People also think that they will end up at their ideal weight, but most just don't lose that much.\n\n'Worse, they think you can take the drug for only a short while and keep the weight off permanently afterwards, but all the research shows that this isn't true: people put the weight back on after stopping the drug.'\n\nBut does the answer lie elsewhere? There are new classes of weight-loss medications on the horizon that act differently from the GLP-1 drugs -- and so may avoid some of their side-effects.\n\nOne of these classes of medication is called controlled metabolic accelerators (CMAs).\n\nThese speed up metabolism by harnessing a natural process in mitochondria, the 'batteries' inside all our cells, to boost the way our bodies break down fat and sugar, and also to raise the amount of energy our bodies burn while they are resting.\n\nIt's a bit like turning up our bodies' internal thermostats so that we burn more calories all the time, thus losing weight.\n\nExcept that CMAs don't raise your body's temperature, according to trials of the first example -- a daily pill called HU6 being developed by the U.S. firm Rivus Pharmaceuticals.\n\nLast December, in the journal The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology, the company published results of a preliminary 61-day trial on 80 adults, which reported that HU6 successfully reduced the volunteers' body weight, with no loss of muscle, and at the same time improved measures of metabolism such as insulin control and reduced levels of body-wide inflammation.\n\nSide-effects were flushing, which a third of participants experienced; diarrhoea, which a quarter reported; and palpitations, which affected around one in ten. None of the volunteers suffered nausea or vomiting (as is a common problem in patients taking GLP-1 drugs). Accelerating people's metabolisms for weight loss is an idea proposed back in 2001 by researchers at the independent Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California.\n\nThe problem back then was that the only known CMA drug candidate was one called 2,4-dinitrophenol -- which is effective, but also potentially lethal.\n\nLast year, a Scottish court heard how 2,4-dinitrophenol had killed at least 33 people in the UK, mostly bodybuilders, who used it illegally to strip fat and achieve the coveted 'ripped effect'.\n\nJamie George, a gym owner who had been making the drug in his home and selling it globally for four years, was sentenced to 37 months in prison after pleading guilty to supplying a dangerous substance.\n\nThe court heard expert evidence that the drug carries a high risk of severe toxicity, and can cause kidney failure, liver failure and cardiac arrest, even at low doses.The maker of HU6, however, said it has engineered its CMA drug to be free of any such dangers. It is now undergoing further safety trials to establish its effectiveness at treating the obesity-related conditions type 2 diabetes and heart failure.\n\nAnother approach showing promise involves using drugs (known as thyromimetics) to boost the activity of our thyroid hormones, which in turn may boost our metabolic rates; in turn, we would shed weight by burning off more calories.\n\nThis simple-sounding approach is complicated by the side-effects. As a 2009 review in the journal Hepatology cautioned: 'An excess of thyroid hormone is associated with unwanted effects, particularly on the heart (including sudden death).'\n\nScientists have since been busily attempting to create thyroid hormone-boosting drugs that are free of such alarming\n\nrisks. Last year, researchers at the University of Massachusetts announced that they had developed a thyroid-boosting drug that, in lab studies, had dramatically reduced weight in obese mice without 'any untoward side-effects'.\n\nWriting in the journal PNAS Nexus, they reported that after five weeks of treatment, the mice's weight dropped to a healthy normal, even though they were still eating the same high-fat diet that had caused them to pile on weight beforehand. Their levels of cholesterol and inflammation also dropped.\n\nThe treatment has one significant drawback: it is delivered directly into the liver by daily injection.\n\nThe researchers said that if the drug was not delivered selectively to the liver, it could 'cause complications' around the rest of the body.\n\nBut while there is still considerable work still to be done, the researchers hope to develop their innovation into a practical weight-loss drug.\n\nProfessor Sattar says: 'These new drug approaches may offer a way of getting around the side-effects of GLP-1 drugs. However, they are still some way away from being approved for clinical use.\n\n'The GLP-1 drugs are not a cure for all the nation's weight issues, but they are here now. We must learn better how to mitigate their side-effects.'\n\nFor surgeon Mr Ahmed, this raises concerns about other effects of these medications.\n\n'These drugs are still quite new and we only have three or four years' worth of evidence. I worry that after ten years of taking the drugs people may develop very serious physical side-effects. We just don't know yet,' he says.\n\n'As for other types of new drugs that speed the metabolism, we just don't know whether they will work and there is certainly a risk of serious side-effects such as heart damage here.'\n\nThere is also the issue common to all drug treatments -- people taking such medication long-term.\n\nMr Ahmed says: 'We know that compliance is very low with people taking any drug long-term, even when it's for something serious such as diabetes or cancer.\n\n'People just aren't good at taking drugs for long periods.'","todayheadline.co","news","TodayHeadline","kathy_d_woodward@todayheadline.co","Kathy D.

Although Musk helped found OpenAI with Sam Altman, staying with the company until 2018, then departing after disagreements about the future direction of the company.\n\nMore recently, Musk has criticized OpenAI over its partnership with Microsoft and other funding sources, both making the products private, non-open-source softwares, and making the company officially for-profit. Musk also announced plans to sue OpenAI and Sam Altman earlier this month, and on Monday, the entrepreneur put his money where his mouth is by announcing xAI's plans to open-source Grok as soon as this week.\n\nBefore xAI, Elon Musk had hopes for OpenAI at Tesla\n\nThe software becoming open-source means that its source code will become publicly available to modify and re-share, which is something that Musk has increasingly expressed as being important in the past few years. Other companies such as Meta and Mistral also offer open-source AI language models.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI shared a blog post last week saying that Musk had already agreed upon moving to a for-profit model in 2015, and even going on to share a series of email exchanges between 2015 and 2016. The post also says that Musk forwarded OpenAI leadership an email indicating that the AI company should ""attach to Tesla as its cash cow,"" in early 2018.\n\n""We need to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending,"" Musk wrote in another email in 2015.

In this scam, TikTok, YouTube or Instagram users are lured into entering promo codes 'CODE29' on Albidex.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account.\n\nBut when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ""activation fee"" in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Albidex.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.\n\nIf you've come across this scam or similar schemes, it's crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. 🚨\n\n🚨 Is Albidex.com a Scam? Beware! 🚨\n\nYes, Albidex.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.\n\nWe did some digging and it looks like Albidex.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here's a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear:\n\n🕵️♂️ No Real Company Information\n\nAlbidex.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it's based. There's no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you'd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites.\n\n🚫 Fake Celebrity Support\n\nThe platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ""giveaways"" that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme.\n\n📣 Tricky Social Media Referral System\n\nThey also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you're promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims.\n\n💸 You Can't Withdraw Your Money\n\nOnce you've put your money in, there's no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Albidex.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn't allow it.\n\nIn summary, Albidex.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can't get it back. They take advantage of people's interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It's best to avoid Albidex.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing.\n\n🚨 How the Albidex.com Scam Works 🚨\n\nAlbidex.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they're all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they're really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it's something new.\n\nThe people behind Albidex.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Albidex.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they'll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.\n\n2️⃣ Using Celebrity Names to Make it Seem Real\n\nThey lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it's a sure thing, but it's all fake.\n\n3️⃣ Getting You to Click and Sign Up\n\nThey make you come to their nice-looking Albidex.com website by clicking on links shared on social media.\n\n4️⃣ Taking Your Personal Info\n\nWhen you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details.\n\n5️⃣ Trapping You With a Deposit\n\nAfter signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That's how they trap you.\n\n6️⃣ They Run Away With Your Money\n\nOnce you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised.\n\nThis is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.\n\nRed Flags Alert: How to Recognize Scams Like Albidex.com\n\nWe've put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Albidex.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table.\n\nWhat to Do If Scammed 😱\n\nIf you've fallen prey to the Albidex.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims. Here's a concise list of steps you should take right away:\n\n🛑 Stop All Deposits and Sharing of Personal Info\n\nCease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website.\n\n🏦 Contact Your Bank Immediately\n\nNotify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take.\n\n🛡️ Report Scam Ads\n\nIf you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: 📱 Open the TikTok App, 🔍 Locate the Scam Ad, ⚙️ Access More Options, 🚫 Select 'Report'.\n\n🏛️ File a Complaint with Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nIn the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you're in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency.\n\n📣 Use Social Media to Warn Others\n\nShare the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam.\n\nOther Online Scams to Watch Out For\n\nWhile crypto scams like Albidex.com are particularly concerning, they're not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for:\n\n1. Phishing Emails 📧\n\nThese are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.\n\nSome online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who's behind them and how they'll use your data.\n\nThese scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.\n\nHere, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ""fix"" an issue that isn't real.\n\nYou get a message saying you've won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It's a trap; you won't get anything.\n\nBe cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.\n\nIn this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.\n\nThe Albidex.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it's just a trick to get your money. And it's not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info.\n\nHere's the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don't fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren't real.\n\nUse this guide to spot red flags, and if you're not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we're quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. 🙏💡","myantispyware.com","news","My AntiSpyware","","","","","https://www.myantispyware.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Albidex.com-WHOIS-Lookup.png","null","-0.4509803921568627","447907852","6","","","",""

Highlights are meant to be what you think are your most interesting posts""\n\nThe Highlights tab which was added by X last year, allows premium users to add some select posts under the highlights tab. The Highlights tabs are similar to how users can highlight their favourite stories on their Instagram profiles.\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time that Musk has promoted the Highlights tabs feature. The billionaire had also promised enhanced reach for Highlighted posts last year.\n\nIn a post in November last year, Musk wrote, ""Posts on X that are added to your highlights tab will get greater reach.Unless you abuse the feature, in which case it will have no effect.

The new update comes amidst a lawsuit filed by the billionaire against OpenAI where he accused the ChatGPT maker to be veering away from its original non-profit mission. Musk has been a vocal critic of large technology companies using AI for profit, expressing concerns about their ethical implications.\n\nThis strategic move aligns xAI with other companies like Meta and France's Mistral, both of which have embraced open-source AI models. Google has also entered the arena by releasing an AI model named Gemma, allowing external developers to customize it for various applications.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press staff writers Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.","wkbn.com","news","WKBN","","","","","https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/65efa111a35247.84657548.jpeg?strip=1&w=640","null","0.06666666666666665","447907216","1","","","",""

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.","triblive.com","news","TribLIVE","associated_press@triblive.com","Associated Press","author","True","https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/03/7135701_web1_7135701-278fa2fb7ef04292a90d7bfd54e557b5.jpg","null","0.01960784313725483","447906292","1","","","",""

Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp., its largest investor.\n\nIn the filing, OpenAI stresses that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because ""there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear."" OpenAI also denied Musk's claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.\n\n""The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,"" OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. ""Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganize and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.""\n\nOpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicized battle since well before the court case. Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. Musk has criticized OpenAI for its commercialization strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft.\n\nIn its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc., his car company. It also said in the filing that Musk was in favor of OpenAI operating as a for-profit company, but only if he controlled it. ""Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the company's lawyers wrote.\n\nMusk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe dispute between two of tech's biggest players touches on core issues of AI safety and accessibility, and has spilled over into the larger startup world. On Monday, billionaire venture capitalist and OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla told Bloomberg TV that Musk could not sue his way to artificial general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI also argues in the filing that if pretrial fact-finding and information sharing known as discovery begins in the case, Musk would use the suit to get access to OpenAI's ""proprietary records and technology,"" and warned that demands for discovery ""would need to be carefully policed.""\n\nOpenAI also asked that the court designate the suit a ""complex case,"" which under California rules is a meant to avoid making the case unnecessarily burdensome for the court and the parties involved. Cases are typically deemed complex and assigned to specially designated judges when they involve complicated and technical issues, as well as multiple parties and numerous claims.","tech.hindustantimes.com","news","Hindustan Times Tech","","","","","https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2024/03/12/1600x900/ITALY-TECHNOLOGY-AI-2_1681362062986_1681362062986_1710207438143.jpg","eng-9383543","0.01960784313725483","447905947","1","","","",""

This certainly wasn't going to be a discussion about underground train systems in LA and missions to Mars ala Elon Musk's chat with Jonathan Nolan back at SXSW 2018.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nHowever, Althoff warmed up as she sat on stage with L'Oreal's CeraVe SVP & Global Head of Digital Marketing, Adam Kornblum, and Chief Digital & Marketing Officer Han Wen. For it finally became revealed how the Aubrey Plaza-type personality became a lynchpin in the grand master marketing plan of the beauty conglom leading up to Super Bowl Sunday with their CeraVe product.\n\nIn sum, Althoff in her Jan. 25 sit down with Michael Cera was an essential component in spreading the intriguing viral narrative that the Barbie actor was the architect of the CeraVe beauty line.\n\nTruth is, he's not. But, boy, did the product's profile get raised from the ruse. L'Oreal bought the CeraVe brand in 2017. The advanced skincare product line was founded in 2005.\n\nThe whole social media sensation with CeraVe began back in January 2020 when filmmaker Tyler Perry made a comment online about needing skin moisturizer. Tom Allison, founder of CeraVe, responded by offering to Perry the product. Allison's tweet to Perry racked up 30,7K likes and close to 2k retweets. Perry wound up take a selfie with the skin product.\n\n""It was a big moment,"" said Kornblum, ""Each day we try to crack the culture.""\n\nIn re-igniting CeraVe this year, Kornblum told the JW Marriot room in Austin, TX that a brief was sent to the beauty company's ad agency ""to create an immersive story. We wanted to do in phases all over digital and social touch points. Then we have this Super Bowl spot. We needed a 360-degree world, how to order codes and dominate culture.""\n\nTheir CeraVe campaign rolled out in three phases.\n\nPhase one: the fake news about Michael Cera developing the brand.\n\nDetailed Kornblum, ""Enter Bobbi who interviews Michael and seriously and directly asks him (about creating CeraVe). He couldn't answer, he just said 'He had skin in the game.'""\n\nIt was a massive moment that went viral sans paid media, discreetly labeled as ""#ad"" in Althoff's post.\n\nPhase 2: There's a public backlash with dermatologists associated with the brand exclaiming how Cera ""doesn't sign our checks."" That phase lasted two weeks.\n\nPhase 3 was the actual Super Bowl ad for CeraVe starring Cera in which he sarcastically says he's the maestro behind the creme. The ad ends with the pull of the curtain and we learn it was all a joke.\n\nBefore the ad dropped, the L'Oreal marketing team had racked up some 9 billion impressions across social and digital about the CeraVe product.\n\nThe upfront strategy relied heavily on PR spurred by Althoff, memes, various news breaks to create ""an organic and earned approach"" per Kornblum. ""We had everyone working -social media influencers from digital to email to SMS; every day was a real-time command center.""\n\nWen added that it was important in the campaign that ""if everything isn't going well, we'd be able to pivot and take punches.""\n\nAlthoff was shameless in her involvement: ""Um, I got an email from my agent at WME, and they were like do you want to work with CeraVe. I clicked it. I looked at the number. I was like 'I'm intrigued' and I said 'yes' before reading the brief.""\n\n""Then I read the brief with my little sister, and said ""Oh my God, Lexi, did you know Michael Cera made CeraVe? She was like 'I had no idea.' We aren't good at reading very well.""\n\nAlthoff received an all-expense paid trip to New York. ""It was the most exciting day of my career. It was like a real film set-up. My podcast is done so crappy,"" she confessed. L'Oreal's team of videographers worked with her Althoff's editors, the influencer having a big say in the creative.\n\nThe appeal of Althoff to L'Oreal was her authenticity. Wen recalled the moment when she met Althoff who shared quite sincerely that the twentysomething named her daughter 'Richard.' Althoff went in that direction, because she wanted to have a boy.\n\n""What resonated with me was that's actually something that everyone can resonate with; it's so hard to script and it's all genuine,"" said Wen.\n\nAlthoff says her personal secret to success stems from working with brands ""that I use in my day-to-day life.""\n\n""It's easier to let viewers know when I'm not lying about something,"" Althoff said.\n\nShe said she wrote a list of ""every brand I use in my day-to-day life and have my agent reach out to them."" CeraVe was a product she use to get samples of from her dermatologist when she was treating her acne back in high school.\n\nEmphasized Althoff, ""I lean into every brand I work with -- I get paid, they get people to buy their product.""","yahoo.com","news","Yahoo","","","","","https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2krUiJNezgShLBHjSjdnDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deadline.com/061f259bede2312bc3d87700e9371852","null","0.2078431372549019","447905864","1","","","",""

The shoes, which quickly sold for $399 a pair, could be purchased with Bitcoin.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the shoes in an interview on CNBC: ""Sometimes let people pay via Bitcoin...it's a form of extra currency.""\n\nThis statement was huge from the former president, who said Bitcoin was a disaster waiting to happen in 2021. His stance has changed since then. According to Trump, ""Bitcoin has taken on a life of its own"" and he ""can live with it one way or another.""\n\nDon't miss:\n\nTrump appears to be going even further by allowing people to buy his shoes with Bitcoin. The action acknowledges that Bitcoin is ""an additional form of currency,"" a huge shift from its past stance on crypto.\n\nTrump has had conversations with former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is pro-crypto and has supported Trump. The conversations centered around the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which Ramswamy opposes. He highlighted the potential harm this could cause Trump. In turn, Trump promised to ""never allow"" CBDCs, showing that he values Ramaswamy's opinion on crypto.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also discusses the crypto projects he is involved in, saying he ""does little things for fun"" and ""does[s] While this does not mean he purchased Bitcoin directly, it is likely a reference to Trump's non-fungible token (NFT) project Digital Trading Cards. Trump collected trading royalties from the project, amassing a stash of over $1,400 ETH.

According to Trump, the last pair of shoes, which was a special edition, sold for $450,000. ""People were going crazy for these sneakers. You probably were too. Everyone was,"" Trump said.\n\nTrump also added that ""so much [of the sneakers] were paid with... cryptocurrency. "" Bitcoin was created to be a store of value and a method of payment. However, it has struggled with mainstream adoption in terms of transactional use. The former president offering the option to pay using Bitcoin could open the floodgates in this regard.\n\nHowever, Trump also noted that he ""would not allow countries to move away from the dollar, because when we lose that standard, it will be like losing a revolutionary war.""

The blog post included emails that Musk had previously sent to other OpenAI cofounders, including one from 2018 in which Musk told company executives that OpenAI should sell itself to Tesla to remain competitive. The company refused, and Musk left OpenAI later that year.\n\nOpenAI's court filing goes even further, accusing Musk of conjuring the supposed founding agreement to form the basis of a lawsuit designed to ""advance his own commercial interests."" It claims that OpenAI did not have a founding agreement or any other agreement with Musk related to his funding of the company.\n\n""Were this case to proceed to discovery, the evidence would show that Musk supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI, to be controlled by Musk himself, and dropped the project when his wishes were not followed. Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,"" the filing states.\n\nThe filing asks a judge to designate the case as ""complex,"" which would, among other things, create some guardrails for the discovery process. OpenAI also said it believes that ""early and swift dismissal"" of Musk's suit is warranted.\n\nOpenAI is concerned that Musk could use the discovery process to ""seek access to OpenAI's proprietary records and technology,"" according to the filing.\n\nMusk is now running his own artificial intelligence company, XAI, which seeks to compete with OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI argues that Musk's demand for relief -- which includes a request to order OpenAI to make all of its technology and research available to the public -- is ""extraordinary"" and would ""benefit Musk, whose own for-profit AI concern has not met with success in the marketplace.""\n\nLawyers for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","aol.com","news","Aol","clare_duffy@aol.com","Clare Duffy","author","False","https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_business_articles_764/f653e14b5c4c08ae66097c9af886e554","null","-0.003921568627450966","447905749","4","","","",""

In an unexpected turnaround in the competition between large companies and magnates in the Artificial Intelligence sector, Elon Musk I ended up processing a few days ago OpenAI and his CEO Sam Altman by terem altered to the essence of the organization after the event of its platform ChatGPT.\n\nAltman and Musk têm an extensive history of attributes where the bilionário on more than one occasion was shown critical, dissatisfied and negative about each movement carried out by this institution whose last part has not passed and with which it apparently ended in terms of few friends.\n\nAt Elon's request, it was just a time quest for him to OpenAI and your reagissem administration council. That moment came with a succulent and explosive revelation:\n\nChatGPT At some point it would merge with Tesla Motors in a clear attempt to acquire an asset with greater project potential for the benefit of another company it owns.\n\nThis revelation brings a new nuance to this discussion, explaining why Elon Musk adopted this attitude against the organization he once defended.\n\nA movement that praises everything, OpenAI published a series of private emails from Elon Musk, co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence company, revealing both his intentions and his position on the future of OpenAI.\n\nThe emails, disclosed in an extensive blog postWe directly and practically irrefutably contradict Musk's recent criticism of the organization and expõem of his past interest in hiring OpenAI as ChatGPT within the Tesla Motors.\n\nThe emails showed that Musk wanted OpenAI to be merged with Tesla or to have full control of the company in all of its projects, including the chatbot that we all know now.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, it is incompatible with its mission to create safe and beneficial Artificial Intelligence for humanity. Therefore, the company argues that Musk only processed OpenAI when it ""started to make significant progress"" in the direction of its original objective, but without it being more involved in the organization.\n\nMost contrasting to all this new evidence is that, contrary to his current criticisms, the emails indicate that Musk initially supported the move by OpenAI to a for-profit model.\n\nIn a message from 2016, he responded ""just like"" to a proposal that the company become ""less open"" in the future.\n\nLater, in January 2018, Musk suggested that Tesla become a ""cash cow"" for OpenAI.\n\nBased on the argument that Tesla was the only company with which OpenAI could compete against Google, it was confirmed that the chances of success were small.\n\nLater, in February 2018, Musk decided to leave OpenAI and ended up founding his own general intelligence company, xAI Corp.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, Musk mentioned that the company has 0% chance of being relevant without a significant change in the execution of our resources.\n\nToday we see that everything has changed, now that OpenAI has financial support from Microsoft.\n\nHowever, the future of OpenAI is still uncertain, but the publication of these emails provides a new perspective on what Elon Musk is driving.","bullfrag.com","news","Bullfrag","jaxon_miles@bullfrag.com","Jaxon Miles","author","False","https://www.fayerwayer.com/resizer/HSydKX_HDS2TUGPOJa6KN6CcSUA=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/metroworldnews/YAN2FJ4WK5G3THHRNZNL3M3S6Y.webp","eng-9383543","0.1137254901960785","447905725","9","","","",""

Trump, in a call-in interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, was asked about his comments last week that seemed to voice opposition to a bill being advanced by Congress that would effectively ban TikTok and other ByteDance apps from the Apple and Google app stores as well as US web hosting services. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it, Trump told the hosts. There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media. When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections. Trump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organisations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The donations which were fully permitted under campaign finance law went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations. TikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the US, most of whom skew younger a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television. Biden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban. The bill passed unanimously by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee calls on China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a US ban. Top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, support the bill. Johnson has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House. As president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) a threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States. The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights. Pressed on whether he still believed the app posed a national security risk, Trump said Monday: I do believe it. And we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights.""\n\nBut,"" he went on to say, you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies, too."" Some American companies, he charged, are not so American. They deal in China. And if China wants anything from them they will give it. So that's a national security risk also.""\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes. He also recently signed an executive order that allows the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to take steps to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans' personal data to what the White House calls countries of concern, including China. Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The US government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening. Trump had first voiced support for the app in a post on his Truth Social site last week. If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,"" he wrote. ""They are a true Enemy of the People!""\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met very briefly"" but that Yass never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics.

Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp., its largest investor.\n\nIn the filing, OpenAI stresses that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because ""there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear."" OpenAI also denied Musk's claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.\n\n""The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,"" OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. ""Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganise and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.""\n\nOpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicised battle since well before the court case. Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. Musk has criticised OpenAI for its commercialisation strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft.\n\nIn its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc., his car company.

A Republican congressional aide not authorized to speak publicly said that's still the plan and there has not been significant pushback to the bill from lawmakers.\n\nA vote for the bill would represent an unusual break with the former president by House Republicans, but Speaker Mike Johnson and others have already forcefully come out in favor of the bill, and dropping it now would represent a significant reversal. ""It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security,"" Johnson declared last week.\n\nTrump said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss.\n\n""Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" Trump said in a call-in interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.

""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing.

Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.""

The move was seen as a direct challenge to ChatGPT-parent OpenAI, a company that the tech mogul co-founded in 2015 and left in 2018.\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nNow, Deepwater Asset Management's managing partner, Gene Munster, has shared his thoughts on Musk's announcement. He believes that Musk's xAI is rapidly advancing and is on track to become the leading private AI company.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Is Currently On A Crusade Against 'Diluted' Oscars: 'It No Longer Commands Respect'\n\nMunster also predicted that xAI will soon need to raise substantial funds to maintain its competitive edge. ""Musk reports that xAI has not and is not raising money, but I believe that will soon change because speed and deep pockets are paramount in the AI race,"" he said, adding, ""When it does, he's going to raise boat loads of money fast.""\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier in February, Munster had predicted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X, would boost the value of his AI company xAI.\n\n""The reason is Twitter's data is powerful (best source of real time intention), and he'll use the data to train xAI to be a top three Foundation Model,"" he said at the time, adding, ""Those models should be valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars.""\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Google CEO's Anxiety Exposed?

But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you're going to make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""\n\n""When I look at it, I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" he added. ""I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.""\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about Facebook's role during the 2020 election, which he still refuses to concede he lost to President Joe Biden. That includes at least $400 million that its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife donated to two nonprofit organizations that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct the 2020 election at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe donations -- which were fully permitted under campaign finance law -- went to pay for things like equipment to process mail ballots and drive-thru voting locations.\n\nTikTok, a video-sharing app, has emerged as a major issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. The platform has about 170 million users in the U.S., most of whom skew younger -- a demographic that both parties are desperately trying to court ahead of November's general election. Younger voters have become especially hard for campaigns to reach as they gravitate away from traditional platforms like cable television.\n\nBiden's 2024 campaign officially joined TikTok last month, even though he has expressed his own national security concerns over the platform, banned it on federal devices and on Friday endorsed the legislation that could lead to its ban.\n\nThe bill being considered by the House would require the Chinese firm ByteDance to divest TikTok and other applications it owns within six months of the bill's enactment in order to avoid a nationwide ban. The legislation also creates a process that lets the executive branch prohibit access to other apps that pose a threat to national security.\n\n""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs,"" TikTok said last week as a House committee took up the bill, passing it on a 50-0 vote.\n\nSome advocacy groups and members that often align with Trump said Monday they disagreed with him on the TikTok bill.\n\n""He's wrong,"" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Trump. ""And by the way, he had his own executive orders and actions he was doing. Now he's suddenly flipped around on that.""\n\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, said it would include the vote in its scorecard grading members.\n\n""The legislation establishes an important national security standard for social media companies: Don't be controlled by a foreign adversary,"" the group said.\n\nAnd, showing the issue sparks strong opinions across party lines, Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he opposed this ""masked effort that will most likely result in TikTok being banned.""\n\n""I think it's going to have drastic impacts for businesses, content creators and a lot of folks in our country,"" Frost said.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he's still confident about the bill's prospects in the House.\n\n""It's going to sail, and then it will be up to the Senate,"" McCaul said. ""And the White House has already acknowledged that they're going to sign it into law. So I think this is a real positive step.""\n\nThe bill will likely need support from at least 60 senators to make it across the finish line and be signed into law. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would encourage colleagues to vote for it. Also, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who is often aligned with Trump, said of TikTok that ""the amount of data and information they have on Americans is very concerning"" and could get in the wrong hands.\n\nAs president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China)"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.\n\nBiden in 2022 banned the use of TikTok by the federal government's nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok owner ByteDance could share user data -- such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers -- with China's authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and wouldn't do so if asked. The U.S. government also hasn't provided evidence of that happening.\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to receive a briefing Tuesday on TikTok from the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials, according to a congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of the briefing that has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump, in the interview, said he had not discussed the company with Jeff Yass, a TikTok investor and a major GOP donor. Trump said the two had recently met ""very briefly"" but that Yass ""never mentioned TikTok.""\n\nTrump also confirmed he met last week with Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative politics. Trump said he didn't know whether Musk would end up supporting his campaign, noting they ""obviously have opposing views on a minor subject called electric cars,"" which Trump has railed against.\n\nAssociated Press staff writers Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.","santamariatimes.com","news","Santa Maria Times","associated_press@santamariatimes.com","Associated Press","author","False","https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/14/414d4587-2a07-5239-93cd-16d3aa0fdd8d/65efb45093bb6.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize","null","0.06666666666666665","447904854","1","","","",""
