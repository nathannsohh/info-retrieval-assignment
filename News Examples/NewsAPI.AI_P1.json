We've had humans orbiting Earth since the 1970s, we have had over 600 astronauts go to space, but the space stations are orbiting under the protection of Earth's magnetosphere.\n\nSo they don't get exposed to the radiation that space has to offer, which differs from what we have here on Earth.

And Musk is also particularly excited about having a backup for humanity. So the idea that if humans are multiplanetary, if something happens to the humans on Earth, there'll be a backup so humans can continue on even if something happens to Earth. So there's a lot of different reasons for wanting to go to space, a lot of different camps, but for me, I think it's mostly awesome.\n\nDetrow: So do you think there's value in these continued studies that NASA is doing? Do you think there's more information to gather about what this is like? Or like you said, is the track record pretty clear, and we know what the challenges would be?\n\nWeinersmith: You know, so I love NASA, and I love their exploration missions. And I never want to really be on the record saying that I am not pro something NASA's doing, but here I go. To me, the value of these analogs can be measured in what you change about your mission plan when the analog is done.\n\nIf at the very end they said, 'OK, we know that humans can't survive isolated and confined environments for nine months because they end up hating each other, so we're not going to go.'\n\nThat would be a concrete thing.

To provide additional context, the Magnificent Seven account for about one-quarter of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and one-half of the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) by weight.\n\nDetailed below are the median price targets set by Wall Street analysts for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWall Street sees upside in six of the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia being the only exception. But Tesla's implied upside of 25% (at the time of writing) makes it the single-best Magnificent Seven stock to buy now, according to analysts.\n\nTesla delivered 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2023, up 38% from 2022. But the company cut prices throughout the year to compensate for weak demand caused by rising interest rates. That stunted growth and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose just 3% to $25.1 billion; operating margin fell nearly 800 basis points; and non-GAAP net income dropped 39% to $2.5 billion.\n\nThe chart below provides more detail on Q4 revenue growth across the automotive, energy, and services segments.\n\nThe investment thesis for Tesla centers on its leadership in battery-electric vehicles -- not only in terms of sales, but also manufacturing technology -- and its opportunities with adjacent software and services, especially those that relate to autonomous vehicles.\n\nTesla accounted for 19.1% of battery-electric vehicle sales last year, up from 18.2% in 2022. That puts the company about 260 basis points ahead of its closest competitor, Chinese automaker BYD. There are several reasons for that success, including brand authority and its status as a first mover, but manufacturing prowess truly sets Tesla apart.\n\nThe company controls costs through factory automation and continuous innovation, such as large castings that reduce the number of parts per vehicle, which makes assembly less labor intensive. Tesla also produces battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric vehicle) at a lower cost than its peers, and that cost leadership is expected to persist through the end of the decade, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors.\n\nThose advantages were overshadowed by economic challenges that caused margins to contract last year, and the situation may not improve this year. Tesla plans to invest in its next-generation (low-cost) vehicle platform in preparation for production in 2025. But the company has earned industry-leading operating margins in the past, and it could do so again in the future.\n\nTesla will build its next-generation vehicle using a new manufacturing system that should cut production costs in half and reduce its factory footprint by 40%, according to management. That should boost margins while also enabling Tesla to build a cheaper electric car, which will extend its addressable market.\n\nWith that in mind, Grand View Research expects electric vehicle sales to grow at 15% annually through 2030.\n\nTesla has a substantial opportunity in software and services, especially where full self-driving (FSD) software is concerned. The company already sells FSD subscriptions to customers in certain geographies, but it also plans to monetize the technology through licensing deals with other automakers and robotaxi (autonomous ride-sharing) services in the future. The autonomous ride-sharing timeline is vague, but CEO Elon Musk has said robotaxi production could begin in 2024.\n\nIn any case, Tesla is well positioned to be a leader in autonomous-vehicle technology given its data advantage. Specifically, with more camera-equipped vehicles on the road, it has more driving data than its peers. That hints at FSD being superior to other autonomous-vehicle platforms because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models. Ultimately, Musk thinks FSD software and autonomous ride-sharing could push gross margins to 70%, up from 18% last year.\n\nFinally, Tesla also has monetization opportunities with Dojo, a supercomputer purpose-built for training artificial intelligence (AI) vision systems like FSD. Dojo reportedly offers sixfold better performance than graphics processing units (GPU) alternatives, meaning it should help the company achieve full autonomy more quickly. As Tesla makes progress with FSD, it may build the cachet required to sell AI cloud services to other companies.\n\nWith that in mind, Grand View Research expects the autonomous vehicle market to grow at 22% annually through 2030.\n\nWall Street expects Tesla to grow sales at 16% annually over the next five years, but that leaves room for upside if adjacent products like FSD software and autonomous ride-sharing services become significant revenue streams. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley sees that as a distinct possibility, and he believes sales could increase at 19% annually over the next seven years.\n\nIn either case, the current valuation of 6.4 times sales is reasonable, though it would be more reasonable if Jonas is correct. So, investors who think Tesla can generate meaningful revenue outside its core automotive business should consider buying a small position in the stock right now. But investors who lack confidence in that narrative should steer clear.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Paying for food and other items with a swipe of the hand rather than with cash or credit used to be a futuristic concept from the Book of Revelation. However, some stores are already using it, including Whole Foods Market and its parent company Amazon at its Amazon Fresh stores.\n\n\"The palm-recognition system works by linking a user's payment information with their unique palm print,\" explains The Expos\u00e9 (United Kingdom). \"If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can also link it with your Prime account - no need to fumble in the Amazon app looking for your in-store code any longer.\"\n\n\"At Whole Foods, you just hover your palm over the reader once you're ready to pay and the system will find your Prime account, apply any discounts and charge the credit card you enrolled with.\"\n\nWhat about facial recognition systems? At the recent G20 gathering of dystopian globalist leaders in Brazil, every attendee was forced \"to pass a biometric validation process by scanning their faces using Serpro's stand devices.\"\n\nSerpro, by the way, is a Brazilian government-run data processing agency that plans to unleash facial recognition all across the land. In order to buy and sell in the near future, one will probably have to undergo a face scan, as well as pay with the swipe of the hand rather than with cash or credit.\n\n\"If they can start getting this technology in place, it will inevitably be adopted by more and more institutions,\" The Expos\u00e9 warns. \"And then someday you may wake up and find that you can't get a job, open a bank account or buy groceries without having your face scanned - What will you do then?\"\n\nApple just released its infamous Apple Vision Pro augmented reality headset to \"augment reality\" on a continual basis, making day-to-day life more of a video game than actual reality. This will tie in well with facial recognition and palm-scanning payment systems.\n\n\"Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499, is the beginning of something called 'spatial computing,' which basically boils down to running apps all around you,\" The Expos\u00e9 explains.\n\n\"And the company's ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids!

All that data has made it possible for them to streamline strategy, plan products, and create new business models that can disrupt traditional players and disadvantage new ones. Vijay Govindarajan, a top management thinker and professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, describes this pivot point as a \"shift from product as sold to product as used.\"\n\n\"We gave these digital giants permission to collect data on how we live, transforming strategy in the consumer sector,\" Govindarajan says. If you don't pay, after all, you're the product (although the European Union is trying to give consumers more competition and control with its Digital Markets Act that came into effect on March 7).\n\nBut much of that digital transformation has taken place in the consumer sector, where some would give up plenty of private data for the promise of a seat upgrade. What happens when Big Tech's playbook becomes possible in the industrial sector -- at the factories, farms, and other players whose business customers are often as complex as they are? That's what Govindarajan explores in Fusion Strategy, a new book with Boston University professor Venkat Venkatraman that publishes today. As the title suggests, the authors examine companies that are starting to combine their physical expertise with the kind of algorithms, AI, and interconnected data sets that have made the consumer tech giants so hard to beat.\n\nI spoke with Govindarajan about why the industrial realm has proven to be tougher terrain for many of the tech companies to conquer. \"In the first round, the digital giants won,\" he said. \"The movie studios, the camera companies didn't take them seriously.\"\n\n\"In the second round, it's not clear the digital giants will win. Industrial companies make physical assets where domain expertise is very important; relationships with customers are critical.\"\n\nWith generative AI and machine learning, industrial players can increasingly connect with customers or partners in new ways to mine data for insights and customized recommendations. But industrial customers are not as willing to hand over that prized data as consumers looking for a bump to first class. The issues over data now being debated in Congress have long been table stakes in the corporation: privacy, transparency, trust, and compensation for the value created. More important, Govindarajan says, companies like Honeywell and Deere & Co. know how to fuse analog machinery and advanced digital technologies to create their own solutions.\n\nTo that list, let me add Collective[i], a B2B company that's quietly amassed an impressive roster of enterprise customers who leverage shared data and the company's proprietary platform to better understand buying and selling activity. The technology has taken years to build and was developed by a team of founders with their own deep expertise. CEO Tad Martin was COO of Overstock, while co-founders (and siblings) Heidi Messer and Stephen Messer created Linkshare.\n\nI spoke with Heidi Messer shortly after speaking with Govindarajan last week and was struck by the similarities in how she talks about the platform. Unlike in the consumer world, these customers don't wake up to discover someone's using their data. They know its value, and the even greater value of sharing it. That's an interesting metric to consider as we look for the next generation of digital disruptors.\n\nIn 2021, Kickstarter announced a pivot to Web3 and blockchain, only to back away in the face of fierce criticism from creators and users.

But there was a catch: Andreessen wanted Kickstarter to embrace the blockchain, leading to reputational damage that the platform has yet to recover from.

There are also physical improvements, such as being able to move around the spacecraft more effectively. What isn't typically considered with artificial gravity, or the lack of gravity throughout space travel, is the impact zero gravity has on astronauts' bone density levels.\n\nAstronauts returning from tours aboard the International Space Station (ISS) were found to have shocking decreases in bone density that can lead to health problems such as frail bones that can easily shatter, and if humans want to travel to distant locations within the solar system, artificial gravity is going to have to be implemented into the spacecraft so they don't arrive at the location with weak bones, or more importantly, return back to Earth with major health problems.\n\nEnter the sci-fi concept that may actually work. Id Software founder John Carmack took to X to tell Elon Musk's SpaceX to demonstrate spin gravity with a Dragon capsule. The idea has long been discussed among the scientific community and shown in multiple sci-fi TV shows and movies. Spin gravity is the creation of inertial force that mimics the effects of gravity. This is typically achieved by rotation and is a technique commonly used by fighter pilots in training to simulate the effects of gravity on the human body.\n\nMusk responded to Carmack's X post and said that Starship, SpaceX's launch vehicle that's headed for Mars, will have a \"small spin on the way to Mars\". Adding that \"even a tiny gravity vector is better than none\".\n\nUnfortunately, this small gravity vector likely won't be enough to prevent decreasing levels of bone density for the explorers headed to Mars, but in theory spinning Starship could actually work. However, for Starship to be able to effectively simulate artificial gravity it will need to be spinning at a rate that's fast enough to generate the appropriate amount of centrifugal force. This engineering problem will take a lot of work to overcome.\n\nSpinning introduces additional problems, such as astronauts experiencing motion sickness and the possibility of spinning, resulting in ship breakage that leads Starship to spin out of control. Despite these challenges, astronauts will need to generate some form of artificial gravity aboard spacecrafts if they want to travel for months without suffering from bone density degradation.", "source":{"uri":"tweaktown.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"TweakTown"}, "authors":[{"uri":"jak_connor@tweaktown.com", "name":"Jak Connor", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/static.tweaktown.com\/news\/9\/6\/96781_326266_spacex-may-use-sci-fi-technique-to-create-artificial-gravity-for-its-trip-mars_full.png", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.1137254901960785, "wgt":447929458, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024398299", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"08:49:12", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T08:49:12Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T08:48:15Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/uk.investing.com\/news\/stock-market-news\/trump-praises-elon-musk-but-slams-bidens-allout-ev-strategy-as-mandate-formed-by-very-very-stupid-people-3377040", "title":"Trump Praises Elon Musk But Slams Biden's All-Out EV Strategy As Mandate Formed By 'Very, Very Stupid People' By Benzinga", "body":"Donald Trump on Monday said he expects the nation's auto workers to throw their weight behind him as he doubled down on his criticism of President Joe Biden's all-electric strategy.\n\nWhat Happened: In a CNBC interview, Trump confirmed a rumored meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, stating that while he aided the billionaire during his presidency and liked him, they held opposing views on electric cars.\n\nHe clarified that he wasn't anti-EV but emphasized the need for alternative options.\n\n\"I'm all for electric cars, but you have to have all of the alternatives,\" he said. \"Also, you can't just go to electric.

Ahead of the March 14th earnings call, I felt the need for a closer examination of the company's qualitative characteristics. In this article, I maintain my price target of $8 per share based on a rising P\/E ratio, Getty's strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), and a forecasted demand growth in the digital licensing segment as a whole. To briefly explain the flow of this article, I first summarize the news surrounding a proposed refinancing agreement and the implications of not pursuing this option. Then, I consider historical trends in the P\/E ratio to support my claim that the company is being primed for growth. Lastly, I explore two qualitative aspects of the company that I believe will later serve as the main driving forces behind this growth (namely, Getty's partnership with Nvidia and growth in the digital licensing segment).\n\nGetty Images launched a plan to refinance senior term loan facilities set to mature February 19th, 2026. The language found in Getty's 8-K filing on 02\/07\/2024 was rather optimistic, suggesting this would result in better loan terms and optimized interest expense. Considering that Getty Images has had an average LTD\/TA ratio of 0.56 since 2022, almost three times the benchmark for technology-based companies, I was skeptical of the optimism. As stated in my previous article on Getty Images, investors need to look for active steps by management to reduce long-term debt if any positive momentum is to be expected, and this just felt like a band-aid was applied. My sentiment was solidified when S&P Global Ratings described the refinancing agreement as \"leverage neutral.\" Consequently, it came as welcome news to me when Getty Images ultimately decided against the refinancing agreement in their 8-K filing on 02\/15\/2024. Getty pointed to below expected interest savings, which I suspected would be the case given that the federal interest rate has been trending higher and may remain stagnant during 2024.\n\nBased on fluctuations in the stock price, the news appeared to be met with a mixed reaction from investors, with price trending slightly upward from February 7th, 2024.\n\nThis news is something that I like to call a \"nothingburger.\" What I mean is, Getty Images planned to enter a refinancing agreement, and then they backed out, so it's just a lot of talk with no change. What can investors take away from this? The mixed reaction of the stock price indicates to me that it is still a good time to buy Getty Images. Management is clearly looking at ways to reduce the company's debt. It simply did not work out in this case. I think it would be overly pessimistic to conclude that management will never find a tangible solution. However, if retail investors wait for news of such an agreement to be in the headlines, bigger investors will swoop in and cause the stock price to rise, resulting in missed gains. This might sound like a bit of reverse psychology, but we can see this already starting to unfold if we review some key ratios in the fundamentals.\n\nGetty Images has lackluster fundamentals compared to Shutterstock (SSTK) and Adobe (ADBE). If the average investor examined the charts below, without knowing the names of the companies, Getty Images would not be viewed as competitive as the other companies. Getty's debt-to-equity ratio has stagnated, total shareholder return has been consistently negative, but curiously enough, the PE ratio has skyrocketed.\n\nAt first glance, one might be inclined to see the above average LTD\/TA ratio, listen to this talk of a foregone refinancing agreement, and conclude that rising interest expense is to blame for decreasing earnings per share, resulting in an increased PE ratio. However, one analyst firm I came across aptly points out that, \"That's how most candidates answer this question and unfortunately that's incorrect. It's an arithmetic answer that fails to account for the equivalent change in Stock Price.\" Examining the debt-to-equity ratio, we actually see a decrease in early 2023, and the PE ratio doesn't increase until after this, so there must be another explanation.\n\nWhile subject to debate, and perhaps a disappointing conclusion for those wanting an objective way to calculate the price of a stock, I believe that a stock price represents nothing more than what a person is willing to pay for it. Consider a quote from Warren Buffett, \"You may have all these feelings about the stock. The stock has no feelings about you.\" Warren goes on to explain that you may remember who told you about the stock, what you paid for it, etc., but the stock price does not care. Over the past 52 weeks, investors have been paid as little as $4.30 for shares of Getty. I am sure that many of those investors combed over the fundamentals, looked at the historical stock price, read news articles, and maybe even talked to friends before placing their order. At another point in the year, other investors paid as much as $4.80 per share, and likely considered many of the same metrics before placing their orders. Regardless of what price was paid, each investor likely posited that all the existing information about Getty Images was already incorporated into the stock price. As conveyed in The Intelligent Investor, assessing the validity of this claim is challenging.\n\nIt is my opinion that a stock price is governed more by psychology than fundamentals. Given the increasing PE ratio and stagnating debt-to-equity ratio, I believe we can infer that investors have placed greater consideration on the qualitative aspects of Getty Images. Therefore, we must evaluate Getty's core business and see if the company's aspirations are likely to materialize.\n\nIn a strategic move, Getty Images and Nvidia are collaborating to develop Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform aimed at providing legally compliant stock photos for small and medium businesses. This standalone version of Getty's initial AI image generator, based on Nvidia's Picasso model trained exclusively on Getty's creative and iStock's stock photo libraries, assures \"commercially safe\" image generation. Investors should take note that despite this assurance, Getty offers compensation of $10,000 per image for any unforeseen issues with Generative AI by iStock, in contrast to the unlimited compensation with Generative AI by Getty Images. The services, priced at $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each generating four images, also promise upcoming features such as inpainting and outpainting.\n\nDemand for AI-generated services is anticipated to double by 2029 (with a CAGR of 11.9%) according to market research firm Valuates. Grand View Research Firm forecasts that the AI generator market size will have an CAGR of 17.5%. Global Market Insights reported a similar CAGR of 16.5% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nIn early 2023, an article by The Verge described Getty Images and Shutterstock as being on the opposite ends of a legal debate concerning the implementation of generative AI for image development. In retrospect, I think this may have adversely affected market sentiment by portraying Getty Images as behind the times, since many believe that AI will continue to play a larger role in the future. On the contrary, I believe that Getty is taking proactive steps to safeguard its content and to secure revenue streams while embracing the future of generative AI.\n\nSimilar to Getty Images, Shutterstock has expanded its partnership with OpenAI by providing the company with access to its image database. Who has the better partnership? Getty and Shutterstock both have expansive repositories, so I feel like we would be remiss if we did not also consider how Nvidia compares to OpenAI. I think the winner is clear from a valuation standpoint. OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, whereas Nvidia just turned over $2 trillion. Not to mention that OpenAI is highly dependent on Nvidia's GPUs, as are many other competitors in this space. However, Nvidia is seldom found among top ranked generative AI companies (look at this article, for example). Based on the resources Nvidia has at its disposal, and the growing trend of generative AI, Nvidia's dominance in this space is not a matter of if, but when.\n\nInvestors should also be leery of the recent lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Personally, I find this case to be very interesting as it relates to the future of AI, but the details of the case are beyond the scope of this article (YouTuber Matthew Berman recently uploaded a video that provides an excellent 40-min summary of the lawsuit). What investors should be mindful of is that if Elon prevails against Sam Altman, Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, this will have a crippling effect on the profitability of OpenAI. In such a scenario, GPT-4 along with other forms of artificial general intelligence would become open sourced and available for the good of humanity. Unrestricted access to this type of technology would compromise the competitive edge of Shutterstock's alliance with OpenAI.\n\nTaking these things into consideration, I think Getty Images has a qualitative edge over Shutterstock through its superior partnership.\n\nIn my previous article during October 2023, the stock price for Getty Images dropped approximately 14% after a downgrade by Redburn Atlantic. At the time, concerns were raised about the future demand of online advertising. Following in November 2023, The Benchmark Company and Wedbush Securities re-iterated their previous rating of Getty Images as a 'strong buy.' Macquarie and Imperial have not issued any new guidance since August 2023. With some time away from the noise of big hedge funds, we have an opportunity to view this from a different perspective.\n\nAccording to information posted by Allied Market Research, photos as a service market are anticipated to grow at an average CAGR of 4.2% between now and 2032. In another market report published by Credence Research, they called for an average CAGR of 7% between 2023 and 2030. Custom Market Insights calculated a similar CAGR of 6%.\n\nGetty Images is operating in a sector where many are calling for growth over a long period of time. With the stock price being psychologically based, what I believe we have witnessed over the past few months is fearmongering. Some big investors think the sky is falling, and this has caused smaller investors to take their lead in an attempt to minimize losses. Minimized losses can also result in minimized gains.\n\nThe outlook presented in my thesis relies on several key assumptions that investors should consider before deciding about this stock. The more likely you think these risks are to materialize, you should invest less of your money in Getty Images.\n\nFirst, my analysis depends on competent management taking steps to eliminate and reduce the company's debt. Aside from management playing an active role in debt management, there could be external factors that prevent Getty Images from making timely payments in the future. If Getty Images were to face cash flow issues from customers who are not paying, or if there is a decrease in the demand for image licensing, then this could lead to the company's insolvency. Getty has a larger debt-to-equity ratio than its competitors, so this matter should be given extra consideration by investors.\n\nWhile the future of generative AI appears to be a promising one, I cannot be certain about the role that Getty Images or Nvidia will continue to have in this space. For now, I assess the risk of a market disruption as low, but if these two companies do not take steps to dominate the space, they are likely to fall behind to Shutterstock and OpenAI. Investors should monitor the news for continued updates about the progress of these companies in the space of generative AI.\n\nLastly, if the digital licensing sector as a whole were to go into decline, this would undoubtedly have a negative impact on Getty Images. However, this particular risk would have similar effects on Adobe and Shutterstock, with Adobe being more diversified and likely more tolerable of such an event.\n\nMy analysis of Getty Images reveals a nuanced landscape where qualitative factors play a pivotal role in shaping the investment narrative. Management's decision to abstain from a refinancing agreement, albeit initially viewed optimistically, underscores their commitment to strategic debt management. The ensuing mixed market response in the days that followed signifies an opportune entry point for investors cognizant of the ongoing efforts to alleviate the company's debt burden.\n\nDespite apparent lackluster fundamentals compared to industry counterparts, the soaring PE ratio prompts a reevaluation of the conventional metrics that govern market sentiment. Recognizing the psychological underpinnings of stock pricing is crucial for a comprehensive understanding this situation, especially in the context of Getty's qualitative aspects.\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia positions Getty Images as a frontrunner in the burgeoning Generative AI market, fostering a commercially safe environment for image generation. This, coupled with the forecasted growth in digital licensing services (as well as AI-generated services), underscores the company's potential for future profitability.\n\nThe anticipated growth in the digital licensing sector, despite short-term market noise, presents a compelling case for long-term investors. While acknowledging inherent risks, notably in debt management and market dynamics, I recommend a cautious yet optimistic positioning. Getty Images, with its strategic initiatives and qualitative focus, emerges as a strong contender in a sector poised for sustained growth. As the market navigates uncertainties, prudent investors may find value in Getty Images by considering the underlying strengths, potential market disruptions, and the evolving landscape of generative AI.", "source":{"uri":"seekingalpha.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Seeking Alpha"}, "authors":[{"uri":"zach_schweinsberg@seekingalpha.com", "name":"Zach Schweinsberg", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/static.seekingalpha.com\/cdn\/s3\/uploads\/getty_images\/458621953\/image_458621953.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.4352941176470588, "wgt":447928494, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024360814", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"08:24:44", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T08:24:44Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T08:24:28Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8039215803146362, "url":"https:\/\/www.rappler.com\/technology\/elon-musk-makes-xai-grok-chatbot-open-source\/", "title":"Elon Musk takes another swing at OpenAI, makes xAI's Grok chatbot open-source", "body":"The move could give the public free access to experiment with the code behind the technology and aligns xAI with firms such as Meta and France's Mistral, both of which have open-source AI models\n\nElon Musk said on Monday, March 11, his artificial intelligence startup xAI would open-source its ChatGPT challenger \"Grok\" this week, days after he sued OpenAI for abandoning its original mission in favor of a for-profit model.\n\nThe billionaire has warned on several occasions against the use of technology for profit by big technology companies such as Google.\n\nHe filed the lawsuit against Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 but left three years later, earlier this month.

According to OpenAI's filing shared by The Verge, OpenAI Inc has asked the Court to designate the case as \"complex\" requiring \"exceptional judicial management\" as Musk's allegations are \"complicated, highly technical, and span nearly a decade\".\n\nOn February 29, Tesla CEO Musk had filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, alleging that Altman's moves -- purported to be driven by commercial interests-have led to the violation of the company's Founding Agreement for developing artificial general intelligence or AGI for the \"benefit of humanity\" and not for individual interests. Musk, in his lawsuit, has sought an order requiring OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement of making its research and technology available to the public. Read more about Musk's lawsuit here.\n\nOpenAI's stance on closed-source AGI:\n\nOne of the core arguments of Musk's complaint was that by licensing GPT-4, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has departed from OpenAI's \"original mission and historical practice\" of open-sourcing its technology. On March 5, in a statement OpenAI explained that the founding members had mutually agreed on a for-profit and closed-source model for acquiring artificial general intelligence. Disclosing specific email conversations, OpenAI argued that a closed-source AI was much safer as it would prevent someone with resources from building a copy and misusing it.\n\n'There is no Founding Agreement'\n\nAccording to Musk's lawsuit, a Founding Agreement was signed between Sam Altman, Musk, and Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI, in 2015. OpenAI has dismissed Musk's claim as fictional and has denied entering into any agreement with Musk.\n\n\"The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him. The documents Musk cites as purportedly memorializing a binding contract with him -- OpenAI's certificate of incorporation and a few emails -- on their face show no promises to Musk,\" OpenAI said in its filing to a Californian Court.\n\nCalling Musk's claims as \"convoluted\" and \"incoherent\", OpenAI also pointed out that any actual agreement, which Musk believed to exist, was missing from the pleading.\n\nMusk seeks to advance his own commercial interests\n\nCountering Musk's fundamental claim that OpenAI has abandoned the Founding Agreement for using artificial intelligence technology for public benefit, OpenAI has alleged that Musk, in fact, supported a for-profit structure for the company. The filing also claimed that Musk intended to seek complete control of OpenAI, and \"dropped the project when his wishes were not followed\".\n\nOpenAI has also highlighted that Musk's plea nowhere alleges that his early donations to the company were conditioned on defendants following a specific business plan. Further, in view of OpenAI's recent technological advancements, Musk is seeking the success for himself, the filing argued.\n\nDefendants Samuel Altman and Gregory Brockman have alleged that Musk's request for \"a judicial determination that GPT-4 constitutes Artificial General Intelligence\" compels OpenAI to disclose its technology that could benefit Musk, whose \"own for-profit AI concern has not met with success in the marketplace\". In November 2023, Elon Musk-owned xAI announced the launch of Grok, an AI chatbot that would compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.\n\n\"Were discovery to commence, Musk would use this suit to seek access to OpenAI's proprietary records and technology and to press for broad merits discovery. Those demands would need to be carefully policed,\" OpenAI argued.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF TECH NEWS: Our daily newsletter with the top story of the day from MediaNama, delivered to your inbox before 9 AM.

That is the question that the Macedonia of new regulations and business movements on the big social media platforms invites us to answer lately. And the answer seems to be mostly no.\n\nThe pioneer in this was the new Twitter\/X by Elon Musk, who, under the banner of freedom of expression and independence, raised the price of Twitter Blue. First, with the option to reduce ads. Then, with a more expensive option of 168 euros per year, to eliminate them completely.\n\nMeta was forced to follow in his footsteps in Europe. And we say that she was forced by the siege of rulings, GDPR reviews and the implementation of the new Digital Markets Law of the European Union.\n\nIn the end, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, launched a subscription model for 9.99 euros per month only for community countries (119.88 euros per year). In exchange, he proposed not showing them ads or taking their data to carry out segmented advertising.\n\nBy the way, TikTok also did a small test with a price of $4.99 per month, just like Snapchat. That remained an attempt.\n\nExpanding the focus to the media, that have opted in recent years for subscription models, we found another case in Spain. Recently, a correction to data protection regulations meant that overnight hundreds of websites offered in their cookie banners the possibility of paying to avoid segmented advertising. The summary, for many, meant paying for privacy, and it does not seem to be proving very successful.\n\nThe large platforms have covered their backs in case these models were very successful among users. The prices for the ad-free option imposed on Meta in the EU are almost twice as expensive as what it generates for each user who sees ads. A sign that he does not want to consider that option even remotely.\n\nIn concrete numbers, Meta's ARPU (revenue per user) on its social platforms in Europe in 2023 was 64 euros on average. That is much less than the almost 120 euros it asks for per year to browse without ads.\n\nThe data of the old Twitter is difficult to know after becoming a private company in the hands of Elon Musk. For information that has been released on a recurring basis The Information They place the number of paying users at around 600,000. Of course: without separating those who pay for the basic option that limits ads to half of those who pay for the Premium+ version to eliminate them completely.\n\nFrom Hypertextual We have contacted Meta and ContentPass, a German company that manages payments for not accepting cookies on more than 400 portals in Spain, without receiving a response when we asked for figures on the number of users who have activated the ad-free options.\n\nBut how many subscribers would it take to replace Meta's revenue in the EU?\n\nThanks to Meta's detailed quarterly and annual reports, it's easy to understand both how much Meta currently earns from advertising, and how many Europeans would have to subscribe to Meta's services to replace that advertising revenue.\n\nMeta has averaged 408 million monthly users over the last 4 quarters. Each user generated an average of $63.97 per advertisement. With these rates, Meta would need just over 200 million European users paying a subscription to replace all advertising revenue.\n\nTo get an idea, we know from the new European regulation that Facebook and Instagram have just over 500 million users. Come on, what 2 out of 5 network users in Europe should pay.\n\nNeither Meta has the bills nor the users seem to be willing to pay for privacy. The other side is the advertisers. It seems that for them there is no end of a way to connect with consumers, clients and users.\n\nDespite his attempts to create the metaverse and augmented reality, Meta's business model focuses on offering targeted advertising based on its users' data. A framework that allows advertisers to reach specific market segments with astonishing precision.\n\nThis not only increases the efficiency of advertising campaigns but also improves user experience by displaying more relevant ads. Meta, in fact, estimates that each of the euros invested in its advertising system generates 3.37and has published statements on its advertiser panels about the new limitations.\n\nHowever, its model has taken serious hits. The growing concern about privacy (or perhaps not so much) and the implementation of stricter regulations; such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and Apple's privacy updates on iOS, have impacted the way companies like Meta collect and use user information for targeted advertising.\n\nMeta reinforced this in its statement announcing these measures a few months ago:\n\nWe believe in an Internet supported by advertising and that gives people access to personalized products and services, regardless of their economic situation. It also allows small businesses to reach potential customers, grow their businesses and create new markets, driving the growth of the European economy. And like other companies, we will continue to advocate for an ad-supported Internet, including with our new subscription offering in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. But we respect the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations and are committed to complying with them.\n\nWe will continue to invest to create new tools that preserve the value that both people and businesses gain from personalized advertising, while allowing users to control their advertising experience on our platforms.\n\nThere are many who have tried to create a social network without ads in vain. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tried it without much success with WT Social.\n\nWith a little longer duration, but also already closed, we find Ello. Launched in 2014, it was promoted as an ad-free space, focused on user privacy and a more authentic, high-quality experience in online social interactions. Ello presented itself as an \"anti-Facebook\" social network. At a time when concerns about data privacy and the ubiquity of advertising on social media were growing among users.\n\nIts business model was based on the idea of not selling user data to advertisers or third parties, and it promised not to show ads within its platform. Instead, This was intended to generate income through a freemium strategy. In it, users could pay for additional features and special services.\n\nEl's design was minimalist and focused on visual content. That attracted a community of artists, designers and creatives in its early days. The platform offered a simple user experience and elegant aesthetic, setting it apart from other more saturated and commercialized social networks.\n\nDespite its promising launch and initial media attention, It ended up closing less than a year ago.. One of the main problems was the difficulty in maintaining and scaling its user base. Although there was an initial spike of interest and a large number of registrations in the first few months, many users found the platform less attractive once the novelty wore off.\n\nFor all this, it seems that the internet advertising model has a lifespan for a whilealthough it will be transformed with the change that the cookie model means in the coming months.", "source":{"uri":"bullfrag.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Bullfrag"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imgs.hipertextual.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/zuckerberg_and_elon_musk_doing_money_with_social-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&quality=55&strip=all&ssl=1", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.01960784313725494, "wgt":447927563, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8024346538", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"08:17:45", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T08:17:45Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T08:14:59Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.800000011920929, "url":"https:\/\/www.latestly.com\/technology\/google-pixel-8a-release-date-google-accidentally-confirms-its-pixel-8a-model-likely-to-launch-soon-says-report-5815563.html", "title":"Google Pixel 8a Release Date: Google Accidentally Confirms Its Pixel 8a Model, Likely To Launch Soon, Says Report | \ud83d\udcf2 LatestLY", "body":"Mumbai, March 12: The Google Pixel 8a is expected to launch in May 2024 with new features and specifications.

Ahead of the March 14th earnings call, I felt the need for a closer examination of the company's qualitative characteristics. In this article, I maintain my price target of $8 per share based on a rising P\/E ratio, Getty's strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), and a forecasted demand growth in the digital licensing segment as a whole. To briefly explain the flow of this article, I first summarize the news surrounding a proposed refinancing agreement and the implications of not pursuing this option. Then, I consider historical trends in the P\/E ratio to support my claim that the company is being primed for growth. Lastly, I explore two qualitative aspects of the company that I believe will later serve as the main driving forces behind this growth (namely, Getty's partnership with Nvidia and growth in the digital licensing segment).\n\nGetty Images launched a plan to refinance senior term loan facilities set to mature February 19th, 2026. The language found in Getty's 8-K filing on 02\/07\/2024 was rather optimistic, suggesting this would result in better loan terms and optimized interest expense. Considering that Getty Images has had an average LTD\/TA ratio of 0.56 since 2022, almost three times the benchmark for technology-based companies, I was skeptical of the optimism. As stated in my previous article on Getty Images, investors need to look for active steps by management to reduce long-term debt if any positive momentum is to be expected, and this just felt like a band-aid was applied. My sentiment was solidified when S&P Global Ratings described the refinancing agreement as \"leverage neutral.\" Consequently, it came as welcome news to me when Getty Images ultimately decided against the refinancing agreement in their 8-K filing on 02\/15\/2024. Getty pointed to below expected interest savings, which I suspected would be the case given that the federal interest rate has been trending higher and may remain stagnant during 2024.\n\nBased on fluctuations in the stock price, the news appeared to be met with a mixed reaction from investors, with price trending slightly upward from February 7th, 2024.\n\nThis news is something that I like to call a \"nothingburger.\" What I mean is, Getty Images planned to enter a refinancing agreement, and then they backed out, so it's just a lot of talk with no change. What can investors take away from this? The mixed reaction of the stock price indicates to me that it is still a good time to buy Getty Images. Management is clearly looking at ways to reduce the company's debt. It simply did not work out in this case. I think it would be overly pessimistic to conclude that management will never find a tangible solution. However, if retail investors wait for news of such an agreement to be in the headlines, bigger investors will swoop in and cause the stock price to rise, resulting in missed gains. This might sound like a bit of reverse psychology, but we can see this already starting to unfold if we review some key ratios in the fundamentals.\n\nGetty Images has lackluster fundamentals compared to Shutterstock (SSTK) and Adobe (ADBE). If the average investor examined the charts below, without knowing the names of the companies, Getty Images would not be viewed as competitive as the other companies. Getty's debt-to-equity ratio has stagnated, total shareholder return has been consistently negative, but curiously enough, the PE ratio has skyrocketed.\n\nAt first glance, one might be inclined to see the above average LTD\/TA ratio, listen to this talk of a foregone refinancing agreement, and conclude that rising interest expense is to blame for decreasing earnings per share, resulting in an increased PE ratio. However, one analyst firm I came across aptly points out that, \"That's how most candidates answer this question and unfortunately that's incorrect. It's an arithmetic answer that fails to account for the equivalent change in Stock Price.\" Examining the debt-to-equity ratio, we actually see a decrease in early 2023, and the PE ratio doesn't increase until after this, so there must be another explanation.\n\nWhile subject to debate, and perhaps a disappointing conclusion for those wanting an objective way to calculate the price of a stock, I believe that a stock price represents nothing more than what a person is willing to pay for it. Consider a quote from Warren Buffett, \"You may have all these feelings about the stock. The stock has no feelings about you.\" Warren goes on to explain that you may remember who told you about the stock, what you paid for it, etc., but the stock price does not care. Over the past 52 weeks, investors have been paid as little as $4.30 for shares of Getty. I am sure that many of those investors combed over the fundamentals, looked at the historical stock price, read news articles, and maybe even talked to friends before placing their order. At another point in the year, other investors paid as much as $4.80 per share, and likely considered many of the same metrics before placing their orders. Regardless of what price was paid, each investor likely posited that all the existing information about Getty Images was already incorporated into the stock price. As conveyed in The Intelligent Investor, assessing the validity of this claim is challenging.\n\nIt is my opinion that a stock price is governed more by psychology than fundamentals. Given the increasing PE ratio and stagnating debt-to-equity ratio, I believe we can infer that investors have placed greater consideration on the qualitative aspects of Getty Images. Therefore, we must evaluate Getty's core business and see if the company's aspirations are likely to materialize.\n\nIn a strategic move, Getty Images and Nvidia are collaborating to develop Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform aimed at providing legally compliant stock photos for small and medium businesses. This standalone version of Getty's initial AI image generator, based on Nvidia's Picasso model trained exclusively on Getty's creative and iStock's stock photo libraries, assures \"commercially safe\" image generation. Investors should take note that despite this assurance, Getty offers compensation of $10,000 per image for any unforeseen issues with Generative AI by iStock, in contrast to the unlimited compensation with Generative AI by Getty Images. The services, priced at $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each generating four images, also promise upcoming features such as inpainting and outpainting.\n\nDemand for AI-generated services is anticipated to double by 2029 (with a CAGR of 11.9%) according to market research firm Valuates. Grand View Research Firm forecasts that the AI generator market size will have an CAGR of 17.5%. Global Market Insights reported a similar CAGR of 16.5% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nIn early 2023, an article by The Verge described Getty Images and Shutterstock as being on the opposite ends of a legal debate concerning the implementation of generative AI for image development. In retrospect, I think this may have adversely affected market sentiment by portraying Getty Images as behind the times, since many believe that AI will continue to play a larger role in the future. On the contrary, I believe that Getty is taking proactive steps to safeguard its content and to secure revenue streams while embracing the future of generative AI.\n\nSimilar to Getty Images, Shutterstock has expanded its partnership with OpenAI by providing the company with access to its image database. Who has the better partnership? Getty and Shutterstock both have expansive repositories, so I feel like we would be remiss if we did not also consider how Nvidia compares to OpenAI. I think the winner is clear from a valuation standpoint. OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, whereas Nvidia just turned over $2 trillion. Not to mention that OpenAI is highly dependent on Nvidia's GPUs, as are many other competitors in this space. However, Nvidia is seldom found among top ranked generative AI companies (look at this article, for example). Based on the resources Nvidia has at its disposal, and the growing trend of generative AI, Nvidia's dominance in this space is not a matter of if, but when.\n\nInvestors should also be leery of the recent lawsuit filed by Elon Musk against OpenAI. Personally, I find this case to be very interesting as it relates to the future of AI, but the details of the case are beyond the scope of this article (YouTuber Matthew Berman recently uploaded a video that provides an excellent 40-min summary of the lawsuit). What investors should be mindful of is that if Elon prevails against Sam Altman, Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, this will have a crippling effect on the profitability of OpenAI. In such a scenario, GPT-4 along with other forms of artificial general intelligence would become open sourced and available for the good of humanity. Unrestricted access to this type of technology would compromise the competitive edge of Shutterstock's alliance with OpenAI.\n\nTaking these things into consideration, I think Getty Images has a qualitative edge over Shutterstock through its superior partnership.\n\nIn my previous article during October 2023, the stock price for Getty Images dropped approximately 14% after a downgrade by Redburn Atlantic. At the time, concerns were raised about the future demand of online advertising. Following in November 2023, The Benchmark Company and Wedbush Securities re-iterated their previous rating of Getty Images as a 'strong buy.' Macquarie and Imperial have not issued any new guidance since August 2023. With some time away from the noise of big hedge funds, we have an opportunity to view this from a different perspective.\n\nAccording to information posted by Allied Market Research, photos as a service market are anticipated to grow at an average CAGR of 4.2% between now and 2032. In another market report published by Credence Research, they called for an average CAGR of 7% between 2023 and 2030. Custom Market Insights calculated a similar CAGR of 6%.\n\nGetty Images is operating in a sector where many are calling for growth over a long period of time. With the stock price being psychologically based, what I believe we have witnessed over the past few months is fearmongering. Some big investors think the sky is falling, and this has caused smaller investors to take their lead in an attempt to minimize losses. Minimized losses can also result in minimized gains.\n\nThe outlook presented in my thesis relies on several key assumptions that investors should consider before deciding about this stock. The more likely you think these risks are to materialize, you should invest less of your money in Getty Images.\n\nFirst, my analysis depends on competent management taking steps to eliminate and reduce the company's debt. Aside from management playing an active role in debt management, there could be external factors that prevent Getty Images from making timely payments in the future. If Getty Images were to face cash flow issues from customers who are not paying, or if there is a decrease in the demand for image licensing, then this could lead to the company's insolvency. Getty has a larger debt-to-equity ratio than its competitors, so this matter should be given extra consideration by investors.\n\nWhile the future of generative AI appears to be a promising one, I cannot be certain about the role that Getty Images or Nvidia will continue to have in this space. For now, I assess the risk of a market disruption as low, but if these two companies do not take steps to dominate the space, they are likely to fall behind to Shutterstock and OpenAI. Investors should monitor the news for continued updates about the progress of these companies in the space of generative AI.\n\nLastly, if the digital licensing sector as a whole were to go into decline, this would undoubtedly have a negative impact on Getty Images. However, this particular risk would have similar effects on Adobe and Shutterstock, with Adobe being more diversified and likely more tolerable of such an event.\n\nMy analysis of Getty Images reveals a nuanced landscape where qualitative factors play a pivotal role in shaping the investment narrative. Management's decision to abstain from a refinancing agreement, albeit initially viewed optimistically, underscores their commitment to strategic debt management. The ensuing mixed market response in the days that followed signifies an opportune entry point for investors cognizant of the ongoing efforts to alleviate the company's debt burden.\n\nDespite apparent lackluster fundamentals compared to industry counterparts, the soaring PE ratio prompts a reevaluation of the conventional metrics that govern market sentiment. Recognizing the psychological underpinnings of stock pricing is crucial for a comprehensive understanding this situation, especially in the context of Getty's qualitative aspects.\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia positions Getty Images as a frontrunner in the burgeoning Generative AI market, fostering a commercially safe environment for image generation. This, coupled with the forecasted growth in digital licensing services (as well as AI-generated services), underscores the company's potential for future profitability.\n\nThe anticipated growth in the digital licensing sector, despite short-term market noise, presents a compelling case for long-term investors. While acknowledging inherent risks, notably in debt management and market dynamics, I recommend a cautious yet optimistic positioning. Getty Images, with its strategic initiatives and qualitative focus, emerges as a strong contender in a sector poised for sustained growth. As the market navigates uncertainties, prudent investors may find value in Getty Images by considering the underlying strengths, potential market disruptions, and the evolving landscape of generative AI.", "source":{"uri":"todayheadline.co", "dataType":"news", "title":"TodayHeadline"}, "authors":[{"uri":"kathy_d_woodward@todayheadline.co", "name":"Kathy D.

Hughes Communications India (HCIPL) and OneWeb have signed a six-year distribution partner agreement to provide Low Earth orbit (LEO) connectivity services across India.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, HCIPL, President and Managing Director, Shivaji Chatterjee said OneWeb will have an early-mover advantage in India, as competitors who are in fray to provide satellite communications service in India are either in the development stage or lag behind in data link speed. OneWeb has submitted an application to the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC) of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for spectrum allocation. Once Spectrum is allocated, OneWeb can launch the commercial services, Chatterjee said.\n\n\"OneWeb having received the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) authorisation is well within its rights to apply to WPC for spectrum allocation, as a VSAT Service provider. Considering both the factors, I hope OneWeb should get the spectrum allocated fast in order to be able to start the commercial service in the first half of 2024,\" Chatterjee added. He said OneWeb will have a significant impact in the mobility space -- aero, maritime and land mobility, cellular backhaul for 4G, defense, off-shore rigs, remote bank and enterprise branches.\n\nSunil Bharti-owned Bharti Group holds majority stake in OneWeb and HCIPL is a joint venture between Bharti Group and satellite services company Hughes. Chatterjee said OneWeb is ideally placed to cater to the requirements of scantily populated villages where it can provide a 50-200 megabit per second backhaul which then can be further distributed to different consumers in that village -- homes, consumer devices, schools, health centres etc.\n\nHe said OneWeb has no plans to provide a direct-to-mobile kind of service like Elon Musk-owned Starlink, as the technology is not yet developed and mature. Starlink is working on technology to provide satellite services directly on smartphones. On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone. Starlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.Chatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.\"As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,\" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.\"We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,\" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.He said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n\"Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,\" Chatterjee said. He said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n\"For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship.

Thus, the market can expect the emergence of new programs from the businessman that will compete with well-known players in this market.\n\nX's strong efforts to create its own video hosting service include partnership agreements with former Fox commentators such as Tucker Carlson and former CNN anchors such as Don Lemon.

Fans Feel for 81-year-old Martin Scorsese, Here's Why - News18", "body":"Did you know Billie Eilish has two Oscars to her name while Martin Scorsese has 'just' one? Internet can't let that sink in.\n\nBillie Eilish's heartfelt song \"What Was I Made For?\" clinched the coveted title of Best Original Song, ensuring that \"Barbie\" wouldn't leave the ceremony empty-handed. The soundtrack for Greta Gerwig's blockbuster not only became a sensation but also a powerhouse in its own right, boasting tracks from top-tier artists. Co-written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, \"What Was I Made For?\" had already snagged the Song of the Year at the Grammys, making it a hot favorite for the Oscars. This marks the dynamic duo's second Oscar win for Original Song, following their victory with \"No Time to Die\" from the 2021 James Bond extravaganza.\n\nAt just 22, Eilish now stands as the youngest two-time Oscar winner in history, a feat as remarkable as her talent, and perhaps a testament to a sprinkle of luck, something Martin Scorsese, at 81, knows all too well.\n\nAlso Read: 'Inception' to Oscars: Man's Ode to Christopher Nolan is 'Plot Twist' No One Saw Coming\n\nThe list of revered directors who never grasped the coveted Directing Oscar -- Kubrick, Hitchcock, Godard, Welles, and more -- seems to render the accolade somewhat arbitrary. Yet, Martin Scorsese, despite his unmatched contributions to cinema, openly harbours a desire for more Oscar gold. While his lone victory for \"The Departed\" stands as a testament to his prowess, his esteemed editor Thelma Schoonmaker insists he's been snubbed at least seven times. With 11 nominations to his name and recent works amassing numerous nods sans wins, the disparity is glaring, to say the least.\n\nAs one 'X' user rightly put it, \"Martin Scorsese: one Oscar, Billie Eilish: two Oscars...That's the Academy of Hollywood.\"\n\nScorsese's career brims with masterpieces, some arguably eclipsing \"The Departed.\" His magnum opus \"Raging Bull\" lost out to \"Ordinary People,\" a perennial source of bewilderment. Similarly, \"Goodfellas\" fell to Kevin Costner's \"Dances With Wolves,\" and the oversight of \"Taxi Driver\" remains a glaring omission.\n\nAdding to that, Scorsese's direction in \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" though not without its flaws, was a masterclass in filmmaking. Despite stiff competition, particularly from Christopher Nolan, Scorsese's skill was undeniable, yet the Oscar remained out of reach. While some hope for better luck with his next project, the Academy's track record suggests that Scorsese's contributions may continue to be undervalued -- a sentiment echoed by many online.\n\nNonetheless, as the younger Eilish graciously accepted her Oscar, expressing gratitude for the song and the film's impact, one couldn't help but reflect on Scorsese's unfulfilled journey with the Academy. His legacy is a testament to cinematic excellence, a narrative sometimes overshadowed by the glamour of awards season.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Says Oscars is a 'Woke Contest', Internet Feels 'He is Just Jealous'\n\nYet, as the internet celebrated Eilish's win, the bittersweet realisation remained: she had her moment, but Scorsese's awaits. And as Eilish humbly acknowledged those affected by the movie, one could only wonder when the Academy might finally recognize the genius of a cinematic titan like Scorsese.", "source":{"uri":"news18.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"News18"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/images.news18.com\/ibnlive\/uploads\/2024\/03\/untitled-2024-03-12t123207.069-2024-03-77d50d9cf02432bf198c6c1c27fc0385-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.3803921568627451, "wgt":447924560, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024279595", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"07:28:49", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T07:28:49Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T07:28:23Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7019608020782471, "url":"https:\/\/uk.investing.com\/news\/stock-market-news\/sam-altmans-openai-rubbishes-nonprofit-founding-agreement-as-fiction-conjured-by-elon-musk-3376947", "title":"Sam Altman's OpenAI Rubbishes Non-Profit 'Founding Agreement' As 'Fiction' Conjured By Elon Musk By Benzinga", "body":"Benzinga - by Ananya Gairola, Benzinga Staff Writer.\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI has refuted the claims made by Elon Musk regarding the existence of a \"founding agreement\" for the company's non-profit status and the non-disclosure of source code.\n\nWhat Happened: OpenAI, a company backed by Microsoft, which was co-founded by Musk in 2015, has dismissed the allegations made by the tech billionaire in a lawsuit filed against them, reported CNBC.\n\nIn a document on file with California's superior court for San Francisco County, OpenAI stated, \"There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear.\"\n\n\"The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him,\" it read.\n\nIn the lawsuit, filed earlier this month, Musk alleged that there was a \"founding agreement\" in 2015 between himself and two other OpenAI co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, which stipulated that the AI lab would operate as a non-profit and not keep information private for commercial gain.\n\nHe claimed that OpenAI breached this agreement by releasing the GPT-4 large language model without providing scientific details for public consumption.\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT-maker has refuted the existence of any such agreement.

However, his proposal wasn't met with much enthusiasm and he left the ChatGPT-parent in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has announced that his AI venture, xAI, will open-source the code of its AI chatbot Grok, this week, while also throwing shade at OpenAI by calling the company itself a \"lie.\"\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: OpenAI, Closed Source?

The company said the billionaire's claims are based on \"convoluted -- often incoherent -- factual premises.\" It called that founding agreement \"a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him.\"\n\nIf the case goes to discovery, there's evidence that would show that Musk supported OpenAI's transition into a for-profit structure, \"to be controlled by Musk himself,\" OpenAI continued. Further, the billionaire allegedly ceased supporting the project when his ideas weren't followed. That statement echoes the company's blog post from earlier this month, wherein it published purported emails to and from Musk from when he was still involved with the organization. Based on those exchanges, Musk knew and was in favor of turning OpenAI into a for-profit entity. He even wanted full control of it as CEO and to have majority equity. Musk also agreed with a suggestion to attach the organization to Tesla, so that the automaker could provide its funding. In the end, the parties didn't come to agreement, and Musk ended his involvement.\n\n\"Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,\" OpenAI wrote in its filing. \"Musk purports to bring this suit for humanity, when the truth -- evident even from the face of Musk's contradictory pleading -- is that he brings it to advance his own commercial interests.\"\n\nMusk introduced his own artificial intelligence company called xAI last year, with the rather lofty goal of understanding \"the true nature of the universe.\" A few days after OpenAI published its blog post wherein it claimed that Musk knew it never intended to open source its technology, the billionaire announced that xAI was going to open source its Grok chatbot.

Former president Trump, who previously ordered a ban on TikTok due to national security concerns, now opposes the ban.\n\nA TikTok ban is on the cards in the United States (US). But surprisingly, Donald Trump, who as US president had passed an executive order banning the popular Chinese video-sharing app, now stands against it.\n\nIn 2020, then-president Trump ordered a ban on new downloads of the TikTok app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, citing national security concerns.\n\nA proposal was even made for US companies to own a US entity of TikTok for managing domestic user data and content moderation. However, legal challenges and Trump's impending departure from office prevented the ban and US industry involvement from happening.\n\nPresident Biden revoked the Trump-era bans on TikTok and WeChat in mid-2021 through an executive order months after taking office.\n\nUS lawmakers are now making moves to ban TikTok once again.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a rare unanimous vote of 50-0, recently approved bipartisan legislation requiring ByteDance to divest its ownership of the app within 165 days or be expelled from app stores and web-hosting services. The bill was unveiled alongside the China Select Committee.\n\nThe \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\" imposes similar restrictions on any app that is purportedly controlled by US' foreign adversaries, including China, Iran, Russia, or North Korea. It establishes a process for President Biden, or any subsequent president, to designate apps that should be prohibited under the law.\n\nThe House Majority Leader announced plans to bring the \"critical national security bill\" to the House floor for a vote early this week. Two-thirds of the members will have to vote in favour of the bill for it to win approval. The White House has indicated President Biden would sign the bill.\n\nThis movement should have ideally pleased Trump and the conservatives who swear by him. But that was not to be.\n\nTaking to his social media platform Truth Social, the former US president : \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nIn saying so, Trump seems to have made his choice for who he considers the greater evil between TikTok and Facebook, and it's not the one with the Chinese parent company and a large American user base of 1,700 lakh.\n\nOnly about four years ago, the former president had said TikTok's data collection posed a threat by potentially allowing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.\n\nHe expressed concerns that this access could enable China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, compile dossiers of personal information for blackmail purposes, and engage in corporate espionage.\n\nThese concerns about TikTok have now supposedly taken a backseat in comparison to who he believes are \"a true Enemy of the People.\"\n\nTrump has been a critic of Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after two of his posts were removed during the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023.\n\nInterestingly, while Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok last month, Trump's has not.\n\nBiotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran for president before suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump, threw his weight in support of the former president's opposition to a TikTok ban. He put out a in which he said the legislation \"doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nRamaswamy said concerns surrounding TikTok, such as addiction among kids and possible sharing of US user data with the CCP, need to be tackled but aren't specific to TikTok.\n\n\"It isn't limited to just TikTok or even Chinese-owned companies in the US. It expands to include even so-called US companies that are still beholden to the CCP because they do business in China,\" he said.\n\nAs an example, he cited reporting from a \"couple of years ago\" in the Wall Street Journal that showed Airbnb was \"providing US user data to the CCP as a condition for doing business.\"\n\n\"Ban US companies from providing US user data to China... But it's beyond silly to pick just one random company and go after them because that is temporarily a politically popular thing to do, while actually failing to solve the actual problem that applies to Chinese companies and US companies alike, including the US companies that do business in China,\" Ramaswamy said in the video.\n\nIn contrast, the former US presidential candidate was \" to banning TikTok outright\" in February 2023.\n\nKellyanne Conway, the former senior aide to President Trump, is also said to be advocating for TikTok in Congress, for which she is being compensated by the conservative Club for Growth. She has reportedly had multiple meetings with lawmakers in recent months regarding the app, according to a in Politico.\n\nBillionaire investor Jeff Yass, a donor to the Club for Growth, holds a 15 per cent stake in ByteDance. Club for Growth leaders have strongly opposed efforts to ban TikTok. Former president Trump praised Yass as \"fantastic\" during a Club for Growth retreat, as Trump sought Yass' support for his presidential campaign.\n\nRepublican senator from Kentucky Rand Paul also took to X to , \"If Congress bans TikTok, they will be acting just like the Chinese communists who have also banned TikTok... Why not just defend the first amendment?,\" which drew a response from Elon Musk: \"Trump's statement there is correct.\"\n\nTikTok, meanwhile, encouraged its users to contact their congressional representatives to protest the new bipartisan legislation, claiming that a ban would violate their constitutional right to free expression and negatively impact businesses and creators nationwide.\n\nConsequently, congressional offices on Capitol Hill were at the receiving end of endless phone calls and social media posts last week.\n\nindicate that both teenagers and the elderly implored congressional staff, highlighting their extensive use of the app. TikTok creators also took to the platform, urging their followers to join the cause.\n\nLawmakers face a significant challenge in arguing that TikTok's national security threat outweighs the desires of the millions of individuals and businesses that use the app, given its .\n\nCivil society groups that even if the bill's language doesn't explicitly censor TikTok or its users, its ultimate impact would be to do just that.", "source":{"uri":"swarajyamag.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Swarajyamag"}, "authors":[{"uri":"karan_kamble@swarajyamag.com", "name":"Karan Kamble", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/swarajya.gumlet.io\/swarajya\/2024-03\/e16588c6-67a3-4c86-80eb-e7d7bdd4df7d\/12_03_3.png", "eventUri":"eng-9380150", "sentiment":-0.1686274509803921, "wgt":447923340, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024250475", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"07:08:40", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T07:08:40Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T07:07:47Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/tech\/musk-says-will-open-source-grok-chatbot\/", "title":"Musk says will 'open source' Grok chatbot", "body":"San Francisco -

The decline of international institutions like the UN, falling usage of the dollar as a global currency, human displacement due to climate change and influence of global tech companies will define the new world order in this century,\" said Dr Ram Madhav, President of the India Foundation on the occasion of 'Capital Talks, A Thought Leadership Series', which began with the lecture titled India & The World - A Perspective from Bharat, organised by the Jindal India Institute of O.P. Jindal Global University.\n\n\"Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.\"\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as \"widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book \"Partitioned Freedom\" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,\" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. \"An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,\" Dr Madhav said.\n\n\"We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared. At the same time, there is the decreasing influence of the American dollar and dollar-based trading which has come down to 58%. So we are entering into a multi-currency system today. And lastly, very interestingly, there is a return of nationalism and strong national identities in different parts of the world. It's a very geopolitical reality.\"\n\nThe inaugural Capital Talks Lecture concluded with a detailed discussion and interaction with Dr Ram Madhav, involving Dr Sreeram Chaulia, Director General of the Jindal India Institute; Dr Mohan Kumar, Professor & Dean of the Office of International Affairs & Global Initiatives, and Ms. Ambreen Khan, Adjunct Professor of Practice & Director Media Outreach and Special Initiatives, O.P.

The discussion and audience interaction covered subjects like developing a discourse on positive nationalism, the need for economic stability, investing in the Indian economy for a double digit GDP growth, and the strength of culture and India as a civilisational state.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by OP Jindal University.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,\" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged. Tesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology. \"There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,\" Harkey said. \"That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.\"\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans. \"Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,\" Toyota said in a statement. \"As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.\"\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's \"ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link\" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received \"marginal\" overall ratings. \"We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,\" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise \"is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,\" not as a safety feature.

On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone.\n\nStarlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.\n\nChatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.\n\n\"As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,\" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.\n\n\"We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,\" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.\n\nHe said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n\"Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n\"For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship. In the Indian context, it will be interesting to see the use cases for MEO,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the other big LEO entrant, Amazon Kuiper is making progress \"but is still 2-3 years away from global commercial service.\"\n\n\"They launched a couple of test satellites a few months back which seem to be doing well. Amazon Kuiper appears to have a big interest in the B2C play too like Starlink ' and will be different from OneWeb in that sense which is focused on Business-to-business (B2B) services,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nEmail query sent to Jio and Amazon on Chatterjee's comment did not elicit any reply.", "source":{"uri":"economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Economic Times"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/img.etimg.com\/thumb\/msid-108425858,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-16380,overlay-economictimes\/photo.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.2078431372549019, "wgt":447922472, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024228013", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:52:39", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:52:39Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:51:40Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/china-technology-giant-xiaomi-starts-062933200.html", "title":"China technology giant Xiaomi starts electric car sales", "body":"Chinese technology giant Xiaomi says it will start deliveries of its first electric vehicle (EV) this month - its first ever foray into the competitive automotive industry.\n\nThe car's price is expected to be announced on 28 March.\n\nChina's fifth-largest smartphone maker says it has 59 stores in 29 cities around the country to take orders.\n\nIt comes as a price war intensifies between firms like BYD and Tesla in China, the world's biggest car market.\n\nAt the unveiling of the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) last year, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said the company aims to become one of the top five car makers in the world.\n\nThe smartphone giant has said it will invest $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.\n\nMr Lei said the SU7 was \"super electric motor\" technology which is capable of accelerating faster than Tesla and Porsche EVs.\n\nXiaomi is also hoping that the car's shared operating system with its phones and other devices will appeal to existing customers.\n\nIt is one of the few new prospective entrants to the China's electric car market to gain approval from authorities as officials try to curb a flood of new players.\n\nThe SU7 will be made by a unit of state-owned car manufacturer BAIC Group at a plant in Beijing that can produce as many as 200,000 vehicles a year.\n\nThe launch of Xiaomi Automobile comes as a price war in China's EV market has been intensifying.\n\nTesla, which is headed by multi-billionaire Elon Musk, has cut the cost of its cars in China by thousands of dollars in recent months as local rivals like BYD have slashed its prices.\n\nXiaomi shares jumped by more 10% in Hong Kong after today's announcement.", "source":{"uri":"yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bbc_us_articles_995\/946828aa9d2d28bffa6689742b81bc7c", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.2156862745098038, "wgt":447922359, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024228182", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:52:17", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:52:17Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:51:46Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.772549033164978, "url":"https:\/\/in.mashable.com\/tech\/71201\/elon-musk-will-open-source-grok-ai-this-week-takes-a-dig-at-sam-altmans-venture-open-ai-is-a-lie", "title":"Elon Musk Will Open Source Grok AI This Week; Takes A Dig At Sam Altman's Venture 'Open AI Is A Lie'", "body":"X\/Twitter and Tesla's billionaire boss Elon Musk's beef with Sam Altman and OpenAI goes back to its founding years. Musk was one of the co-founders of the AI non-profit, which commenced on December 11, 2015. Citing a conflict of interest with his upcoming venture at Neuralink, Musk exited the OpenAI board in 2018. With ChatGPT's phenomenal success, Musk went on a tirade dissing OpenAI's novel AI chatbot, deeming it harmful. While he announced (and later launched) Grok AI by his AI company xAI, ChatGPT's rival, Musk slammed his former startup for collaborating with Microsoft and turning for-profit. Sam Altman's venture further drew criticism for not open-sourcing its LLMs, drawing the moniker 'ClosedAI' from Elon Musk and others.\n\nTaking another swing at OpenAI, Musk has now announced that he will open source Grok AI within this week. Grok would join the league of other open source AIs, including Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta and French firm Minstral AI. Google's AI model, Gemma, too, allows developers to customize it. In his Twitter tirade, while announcing Grok going open source, Musk again accused that 'OpenAI is a lie.'\n\nAs OpenAI unveiled text-to-video AI model Sora, Musk filed a lawsuit against the company for going astray of its purpose and abandoning its mission of staying non-profit for the benefit of humanity. Reacting to an OpenAI statement concerning the same, Elon Musk remarked that he would drop the lawsuit if OpenAI changed their name to ClosedAI.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Claims Tesla's AI Render Better Physics Than OpenAI's Sora; Plans Of Releasing Video Games Too\n\nSee Also: OpenAI Shares Elon Musk's Emails, Says He Wanted 'Full Control' Of The Company\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Suggests Directors Who Could Stand Up To Sam Altman Amid Rumors Of OpenAI Achieving AGI", "source":{"uri":"in.mashable.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Mashable India"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/sm.mashable.com\/mashable_in\/seo\/6\/69684\/69684_4rvx.jpg", "eventUri":"eng-9383543", "sentiment":0.04313725490196085, "wgt":447922337, "relevance":14}, {"uri":"8024225109", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:50:21", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:50:21Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:49:25Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/china-technology-giant-xiaomi-starts-062933200.html", "title":"China technology giant Xiaomi starts electric car sales", "body":"Chinese technology giant Xiaomi says it will start deliveries of its first electric vehicle (EV) this month - its first ever foray into the competitive automotive industry.\n\nThe car's price is expected to be announced on 28 March.\n\nChina's fifth-largest smartphone maker says it has 59 stores in 29 cities around the country to take orders.\n\nIt comes as a price war intensifies between firms like BYD and Tesla in China, the world's biggest car market.\n\nAt the unveiling of the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) last year, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said the company aims to become one of the top five car makers in the world.\n\nThe smartphone giant has said it will invest $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.\n\nMr Lei said the SU7 was \"super electric motor\" technology which is capable of accelerating faster than Tesla and Porsche EVs.\n\nXiaomi is also hoping that the car's shared operating system with its phones and other devices will appeal to existing customers.\n\nIt is one of the few new prospective entrants to the China's electric car market to gain approval from authorities as officials try to curb a flood of new players.\n\nThe SU7 will be made by a unit of state-owned car manufacturer BAIC Group at a plant in Beijing that can produce as many as 200,000 vehicles a year.\n\nThe launch of Xiaomi Automobile comes as a price war in China's EV market has been intensifying.\n\nTesla, which is headed by multi-billionaire Elon Musk, has cut the cost of its cars in China by thousands of dollars in recent months as local rivals like BYD have slashed its prices.\n\nXiaomi shares jumped by more 10% in Hong Kong after today's announcement.", "source":{"uri":"ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bbc_us_articles_995\/946828aa9d2d28bffa6689742b81bc7c", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.2156862745098038, "wgt":447922221, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024223481", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:49:05", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:49:05Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:48:09Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.thecambodianews.net\/news\/274154069\/a-heteropolar-world-the-rise-of-china-and-a-new-cold-war-mark-the-changing-world-order-dr-ram-madhav-president-india-foundation", "title":"\"A Heteropolar World, the Rise of China, and a New Cold War Mark the Changing World Order\", Dr Ram Madhav, President India Foundation", "body":"OP Jindal University\n\nNew Delhi [India], March 12: A heteropolar world, the rise of China, and a new Cold War mark the changing world order today. The decline of international institutions like the UN, falling usage of the dollar as a global currency, human displacement due to climate change and influence of global tech companies will define the new world order in this century,\" said Dr Ram Madhav, President of the India Foundation on the occasion of 'Capital Talks, A Thought Leadership Series', which began with the lecture titled India & The World - A Perspective from Bharat, organised by the Jindal India Institute of O.P. Jindal Global University.\n\n\"Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.\"\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as \"widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book \"Partitioned Freedom\" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,\" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. \"An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,\" Dr Madhav said.\n\n\"We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared. At the same time, there is the decreasing influence of the American dollar and dollar-based trading which has come down to 58%. So we are entering into a multi-currency system today. And lastly, very interestingly, there is a return of nationalism and strong national identities in different parts of the world. It's a very geopolitical reality.\"\n\nThe inaugural Capital Talks Lecture concluded with a detailed discussion and interaction with Dr Ram Madhav, involving Dr Sreeram Chaulia, Director General of the Jindal India Institute; Dr Mohan Kumar, Professor & Dean of the Office of International Affairs & Global Initiatives, and Ms. Ambreen Khan, Adjunct Professor of Practice & Director Media Outreach and Special Initiatives, O.P. Jindal Global University. The discussion and audience interaction covered subjects like developing a discourse on positive nationalism, the need for economic stability, investing in the Indian economy for a double digit GDP growth, and the strength of culture and India as a civilisational state.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by OP Jindal University.

Once Spectrum is allocated, OneWeb can launch the commercial services, Chatterjee said.\n\n\"OneWeb having received the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) authorisation is well within its rights to apply to WPC for spectrum allocation, as a VSAT Service provider. Considering both the factors, I hope OneWeb should get the spectrum allocated fast in order to be able to start the commercial service in the first half of 2024,\" Chatterjee added.\n\nHe said OneWeb will have a significant impact in the mobility space -- aero, maritime and land mobility, cellular backhaul for 4G, defense, off-shore rigs, remote bank and enterprise branches.\n\nSunil Bharti-owned Bharti Group holds majority stake in OneWeb and HCIPL is a joint venture between Bharti Group and satellite services company Hughes.\n\nChatterjee said OneWeb is ideally placed to cater to the requirements of scantily populated villages where it can provide a 50-200 megabit per second backhaul which then can be further distributed to different consumers in that village -- homes, consumer devices, schools, health centres etc.\n\nHe said OneWeb has no plans to provide a direct-to-mobile kind of service like Elon Musk-owned Starlink, as the technology is not yet developed and mature.\n\nStarlink is working on technology to provide satellite services directly on smartphones. On March 3, Musk announced that SpaceX has achieved peak download speed of 17 mbps from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone.\n\nStarlink has applied for a permit to provide services in India but it is yet to get an approval.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate spectrum to satellite communication companies without auction through an administrative process for point-to-point connection.\n\nChatterjee said administrative allocation of spectrum does not necessarily mean that spectrum will be free.\n\n\"As a VSAT service provider, we are paying 4 per cent of our revenue to the government as Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)... This 4 per cent SUC is in addition to the license fee charge which is 8 per cent of our revenue,\" Chatterjee said, adding that this 12 per cent is quite substantial.\n\n\"We are waiting for more clarity on the details of the administrative allocation of spectrum, including the charges for the same,\" he said.\n\nTalking about the early-mover advantage, Chatterjee said JioSpace Fibre is the brand name for the MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) service mPower. Jio has partnered Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to provide satellite communication services in India.\n\nHe said MEO is a global constellation construct and needs a total of 13 satellites to complete the constellation. As of now, mPower has six satellites in orbit and the constellation is not complete.\n\n\"Additionally, SES has gone on record to mention that the first six satellites have some electrical issues and they are working through that. It is not yet clear as to when the service will be available in India. This service is also awaiting INSPACe authorisation,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the MEO orbit is at 10,000 kms compared to LEO orbits of around 600-1200 kms.\n\n\"For pure latency sensitivity, LEO is the best fit. However, MEO has been seen to be successful in applications like islands which have no fiber, or large cruise ships that need hundreds of Mbps per ship. In the Indian context, it will be interesting to see the use cases for MEO,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nHe said that the other big LEO entrant, Amazon Kuiper is making progress \"but is still 2-3 years away from global commercial service.\" \"They launched a couple of test satellites a few months back which seem to be doing well. Amazon Kuiper appears to have a big interest in the B2C play too like Starlink '\" and will be different from OneWeb in that sense which is focused on Business-to-business (B2B) services,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nEmail query sent to Jio and Amazon on Chatterjee's comment did not elicit any reply.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n\"There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,\" Harkey said. \"That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.\"\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n\"Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,\" Toyota said in a statement. \"As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.\"\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's \"ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link\" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received \"marginal\" overall ratings.\n\n\"We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,\" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise \"is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,\" not as a safety feature.\n\nDifferent assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz , BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received \"poor\" overall ratings, although all achieved \"good\" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n\"This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,\" Mercedes said in a statement. \"We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.\"\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved \"good\" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n\"We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,\" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday. BMW now offers in certain U.S. models a more sophisticated driving-assistance system than the one tested by the IIHS.\n\nThe Genesis GV80 SUV that launches in the U.S. this spring will the first model in the Hyundai luxury brand with an in-cabin camera to monitor the driver's face and eyes while assisted driving is engaged. \"This enhancement will also be rolling out to future Genesis products in the coming months and years,\" the company said.\n\nRead Comments ()", "source":{"uri":"thehindu.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"The Hindu"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/th-i.thgim.com\/public\/incoming\/sgusr8\/article67941774.ece\/alternates\/LANDSCAPE_1200\/Tesla_Hazzardous_Waste_32974.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.01960784313725494, "wgt":447921323, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024197167", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:31:22", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:31:22Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:30:29Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7568627595901489, "url":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/trends\/adda247-teacher-proposes-to-colleague-during-live-class-video-is-viral-12443601.html", "title":"Adda247 teacher proposes to colleague during live class.

Despite leaving OpenAI a few years after its inception, Musk recently initiated a lawsuit against the organization, accusing it of deviating from its founding non-profit principles of widely sharing AI research.\n\nIn a move that thrusts him into the heart of Silicon Valley's intense debate over AI's future, Musk announced via a post on X that Grok would soon become open source. This decision aligns Musk with one faction of the tech community advocating for open source AI, which allows for broader access to the technology's framework, thereby facilitating innovation and development of new travel and tourism applications.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from this open-source approach. By enabling more developers and startups to access and innovate with Grok's AI technology, the sector could see advancements in personalized travel recommendations, automated customer service, and enhanced language translation services, enriching the global travel experience.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Meta champion the open-source model, promoting a collaborative and transparent approach to AI development. In contrast, entities like OpenAI and Google opt for a more guarded stance, prioritizing the protection of technology and the financial implications of AI advancements.\n\nMusk's lawsuit and his push for open sourcing Grok underscore a broader narrative of competing visions for AI's evolution, with Musk challenging the industry to reconsider its approach to technology sharing.

The platform is currently facing opposition from several lawmakers who crafted legislation looking to ban the platform in the U.S., which Congress is planning to vote on on March 13.\n\nAnd now, with TikTok's future up in the air, it looks like its potential downfall has attracted the attention of potential buyers, one who may have an interest in using data from the platform's users to help train its artificial intelligence models.\n\nFormer Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has \"expressed interest\" to ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming that he is looking to buy TikTok from the parent company if it's looking to sell the platform, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRelated: Despite what Elon Musk says, X is failing\n\nKotick was CEO of Activision, which is home to the beloved game Call of Duty, for 32 years.

The report claims that \"OpenAI could use TikTok to help train its AI models if a partner such as Kotick could raise the capital for such an acquisition.\" The report also reveals that the cost to acquire TikTok could be \"hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\nTraining AI models often involves feeding data to algorithms to help it make accurate predictions or decisions. Many companies looking to train their AI models often look to harvest user data on their platforms to help develop these technologies, which has sparked backlash from users who want their data to remain private.\n\nByteDance has responded to the Journal's report in a statement on March 10 by denying that it has been approached by potential buyers. In an English translation of the statement, ByteDance claimed that the detail in the report is \"untrue\" as \"Yiming has not communicated relevant matters with anyone.\"\n\nTikTok is getting the boot from U.S. lawmakers as they claim in a proposed bipartisan bill that banning the platform would \"protect the national security of the United States.\"\n\nLawmakers have expressed concerns that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, may give the Chinese government access to sensitive user data on the platform and that the platform itself may contribute to the spread of misinformation online, accusations that TikTok's CEO has denied.\n\nAfter the bill started progressing in Congress, TikTok began sending users a notice on its platform that the app is \"at risk of being shut down in the U.S.,\" and that users should call their local congressional representative and \"speak up now\" before their right of \"free expression\" is taken away.\n\nTikTok also claimed in the notification that banning the app could \"damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience.\"", "source":{"uri":"dcourier.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"The Daily Courier"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com\/img\/photos\/2024\/03\/11\/in-this-photo-illustration-a-tiktok-logo-seen-displayed-on-a_91F8FCE.jpg", "eventUri":"eng-9382858", "sentiment":0.01960784313725483, "wgt":447920529, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024185205", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:21:14", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:21:14Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T06:20:32Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/www.aninews.in\/news\/business\/a-heteropolar-world-the-rise-of-china-and-a-new-cold-war-mark-the-changing-world-order-dr-ram-madhav-president-india-foundation20240312114621\/", "title":"\"A Heteropolar World, the Rise of China, and a New Cold War Mark the Changing World Order\", Dr Ram Madhav, President India Foundation", "body":"OP Jindal University\n\nNew Delhi [India], March 12: A heteropolar world, the rise of China, and a new Cold War mark the changing world order today. The decline of international institutions like the UN, falling usage of the dollar as a global currency, human displacement due to climate change and influence of global tech companies will define the new world order in this century,\" said Dr Ram Madhav, President of the India Foundation on the occasion of 'Capital Talks, A Thought Leadership Series', which began with the lecture titled India & The World - A Perspective from Bharat, organised by the Jindal India Institute of O.P. Jindal Global University.\n\n\"Today, we notice that there is a perceptible decline in the influence of the Western powers. The West will remain a very powerful bloc. Especially countries like America will remain technological leaders, economic leaders in the world. But in the new world which is now shaping up, you will probably not see any more unipolarity. Then there is the rise of China. A perceptible rise of China despite certain contemporary challenges it is facing in terms of its economic stagnation etc. is an important development in this century. It has become almost as big an economy as America today in terms of GDP figures. Today, there are a growing number of flashpoints in the world indicating a 'new Cold War' like situation which countries don't admit for tactical reasons. Leaders of smaller countries feel this pressure to take sides and that itself indicates that there is a growing Cold War-like situation. Then we need to see the rise of a few middle powers. Multiple independent powers at the middle level are growing. You know, when I say middle powers, I'm not just talking about countries alone. There are a number of minilaterals emerging. They're strong groups. What we are seeing include Shanghai Cooperation Organization, EU or ASEAN. These small groups of countries are trying to emerge as important power blocks in the world.\"\n\nWelcoming Dr Ram Madhav to the inaugural lecture under the Capital Talk Series organized by JGU, Dr C Raj Kumar, the Founding Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, spoke about the phenomenal growth of JGU in a span on 15 years and introduced the keynote speaker to an audience comprising diplomats, intellectuals, business professionals and students. Dr Raj Kumar described Dr Ram Madhav as \"widely regarded for his contributions in the field of strategic thinking, political philosophy and India's foreign policy. He has been the curator of major annual global and national multilateral initiatives like the Indian Ocean Conference, the Dharma-Dhamma Conference, ASEAN-India Youth Summit and Counter Terrorism Conference. Most recently, Dr Madhav has been instrumental in ideating the Religon-20 Forum (R20) as part of G20 and his most recent book \"Partitioned Freedom\" explores the untold history of India's partition in 1947 and the birth of Pakistan,\" he said.\n\nDr Ram Madhav further elucidated that today, there is a decline of global multilateral institutions, which were created after the Second World War. The United Nations is far less influential. And from India's point of view, we have made it very clear that unless important reforms are effected to the institutions, they will continue to become less important in the world. On the other hand, big tech corporations are emerging as major power players in the world. \"An Elon Musk can decide many things in this world beyond the sovereignty of nations. Google or Facebook and Apple can play an important role in shaping many things in the world. So, beyond sovereign nation-states, these poles are also rising. Multinational corporations, global big tech companies, they are emerging to be highly influential. Global NGOs like Rockefeller Foundation are very powerful. We now have multinational terrorist organizations which are dictating terms of how you fight. So many such forces are rising, especially religious groups which are emerging as important,\" Dr Madhav said.\n\n\"We are living in a heteropolar reality. We have now have entered into a very major tech era. This is a very frontier type of tech era defined by Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to be a challenge to every country. It is a technology by everyone today because we are entering into an era of redundant humans, intelligent machines. Climate change is a much talked about issue. This climate change will lead to displacement of 1.2 billion people in next 10 years. Imagine the pressure that it is going to cause especially to countries in Europe, because there will be displacement in Africa and also mass displacement in many island nations in the world. So it is going to cause major human suffering and that will lead to so many consequences for which we are to be prepared. At the same time, there is the decreasing influence of the American dollar and dollar-based trading which has come down to 58%. So we are entering into a multi-currency system today. And lastly, very interestingly, there is a return of nationalism and strong national identities in different parts of the world. It's a very geopolitical reality.\"\n\nThe inaugural Capital Talks Lecture concluded with a detailed discussion and interaction with Dr Ram Madhav, involving Dr Sreeram Chaulia, Director General of the Jindal India Institute; Dr Mohan Kumar, Professor & Dean of the Office of International Affairs & Global Initiatives, and Ms. Ambreen Khan, Adjunct Professor of Practice & Director Media Outreach and Special Initiatives, O.P.

Recently, SpaceX had to remove some satellites due to a potential design flaw.\n\nDespite this setback, Starlink has been making progress, managing to decrease the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another in its network by more than 30 percent for users in the United States.\n\nIn simpler terms, this implies that internet connections provided by Starlink are becoming faster and more responsive for people in the US, leading to a better overall internet experience.\n\nSpaceX is also ensuring that Starlink works with popular smartphones like iPhones and Samsung Galaxies. They're offering different internet plans too, so people can choose the one that best suits their needs.\n\nCurrently, Starlink is also available in the US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.

A massive protest took place near the Gr\u00fcnheide factory on March 10 involving hundreds of environmental activists who are against Tesla's expansion of the plant.\n\nRelated: Analysts have surprising take on Magnificent 7 amid tech-bubble echoes\n\nAt the same time, local residents and plant workers staged a counter demonstration showing support for the American EV automaker.\n\nOn the bright side, the electricity at the Gr\u00fcnheide facility could be restored as soon as the evening of March 11.\n\nThese are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals.\n\nStopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nPreviously, the automaker anticipated power would not be restored until March 17. However, the local power company is anticipating power resumption to come sooner.\n\nTesla and other EV automakers are also facing weakening sales.\n\nGrowth in the global electric-vehicle market is set to slow to 27.1% this year as a reduction in state subsidies makes the cars less appealing to buyers, according to the research firm Canalys.\n\nThe figure follows an estimated growth of 29% in 2023 at 13.7 million units, when government incentives helped the adoption of EVs.\n\nDespite a 20% drop in the average sales price of EVs in 2023, Jason Low, principle analyst at Canalys said that \"insufficient product choices and inconvenient charging experience hampered demand, impacting the market growth of EVs.\"\n\nIn January Tesla itself warned investors that vehicle-delivery growth rates would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels, with earnings likely to decline given its focus on price cuts.\n\nWeaker-than-expected sales figures from China are also adding to overall pressures on Tesla's aggressive delivery targets.\n\nBulls express concerned\n\nLast week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, lowered his price target by $25 to $320 on the company's shares, saying that electric-vehicle demand was continuing to weaken in key markets including China despite the price cuts.\n\nInvestor Gary Black, another well-known Tesla bull, drew questions from some investors recently after his Future Fund chose to cut its position in the electric-vehicle maker, saying that Wall Street's first-quarter estimates for the electric vehicle maker remain too high.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nDeutsch Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner had a similar view, which he detailed in a March 11 investor's note.\n\nThe analyst said that he expected Tesla's first quarter deliveries and earnings to miss Wall Street's current expectations \"by a wide margin and continue to see material downside risk to full-year 2024.\"\n\nHe cited several factors, including low Model 3 production in the U.S. since the company's Highland refresh, a particularly slow Cybertruck ramp up, and overall pressure globally from weak EV demand.\n\nThe analyst also cut his full year delivery estimate to roughly 1.96 million units, which represents only high single digit growth for the year, compared with a prior mid-teens forecast.\n\n\"We see pressure on margins and earnings, as the company already announced deep price cuts in both China and Europe earlier in the quarter, and made further moderate price adjustments in February to incentivize vehicle purchases,\" Rosner said.\n\nThe analyst also said that the slower ramp up in Model 3 in the U.S. and an earlier factory shut down as well as the recent arson attack at the Berlin facility will have an impact factory efficiency gains, he said.\n\nWith the new labor costs and the margin dilutive Cybertruck coming on line at the start of 2024, the analyst said that he expect first-quarter margin to slide deeper on a quarter-over-quarter basis, \"with limited room for improvement throughout the year.\"", "source":{"uri":"dcourier.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"The Daily Courier"}, "authors":[{"uri":"daily_courier@dcourier.com",

Non-Profit 'Founding Agreement' As 'Fiction' Conjured By Elon Musk", "body":"Loading...Loading...\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI has refuted the claims made by Elon Musk regarding the existence of a \"founding agreement\" for the company's non-profit status and the non-disclosure of source code.\n\nWhat Happened: OpenAI, a company backed by Microsoft, which was co-founded by Musk in 2015, has dismissed the allegations made by the tech billionaire in a lawsuit filed against them, reported CNBC.\n\nIn a document on file with California's superior court for San Francisco County, OpenAI stated, \"There is no Founding Agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear.\"\n\n\"The Founding Agreement is instead a fiction Musk has conjured to lay unearned claim to the fruits of an enterprise he initially supported, then abandoned, then watched succeed without him,\" it read.\n\nSee Also: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Thinks Even Free AI Chips From Rivals Are 'Not Cheap Enough' Compared To Its GPUs\n\nIn the lawsuit, filed earlier this month, Musk alleged that there was a \"founding agreement\" in 2015 between himself and two other OpenAI co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, which stipulated that the AI lab would operate as a non-profit and not keep information private for commercial gain.\n\nHe claimed that OpenAI breached this agreement by releasing the GPT-4 large language model without providing scientific details for public consumption.\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT-maker has refuted the existence of any such agreement. The company has called Musk's case frivolous and stated that Musk himself supported a for-profit structure for OpenAI.\n\n\"Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,\" the document read. \"So he brings this action accusing Defendants of breaching a contract that never existed and duties Musk was never owed, demanding relief calculated to benefit a competitor to OpenAI.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: Following Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla characterized the legal action as a \"salve on a bruised ego,\" suggesting that Musk's decision to sue was driven by his ego rather than any legitimate grievance.\n\nEarlier, it was also revealed that Musk had once suggested that OpenAI's only path to compete with Alphabet Inc.'s Google was through a merger with Tesla. However, his proposal wasn't met with much enthusiasm and he left the ChatGPT-parent in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has announced that his AI venture, xAI, will open-source the code of its AI chatbot Grok, this week, while also throwing shade at OpenAI by calling the company itself a \"lie.\"\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: OpenAI, Closed Source?

Mobile phones were used in Star Trek before they existed in the real world. Writers imagined bionic limbs, military tanks, submarines and the internet before their actual creation. As the American academic John Jordan writes in Robots (2016): \"Science fiction set the boundaries of the conceptual playing field before the engineers did.\"\n\nNo technology has been as richly imagined before its commercial launch as artificial intelligence (AI). Science fiction has informed existing concepts of AI, what it is and what it might do, more than any other technology in history. But whose plots are these? In November, Rishi Sunak interviewed Elon Musk. It didn't take long before their conversation turned to science fiction. Musk mentioned his fear of killer robots. Sunak expressed relief that, at least in the films that he had seen, these monsters had an \"off-switch\" that made it possible to shut them down before they could destroy the world.\n\nSunak may have been referring to the story about AI and paper clips. It's a tale that the Oxford professor Nick Bostr\u00f6m first told in 2014. It has been repeated many times since and even played a part among the fears that led to the temporary sacking of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI (the company known for creating ChatGPT) last year. The story goes something like this: once upon a time there was an artificial intelligence that was given the task of making paper clips. But as the AI redesigned itself to be more effective (as it had been told to do) it decided that the best way to maximise output was to destroy human civilisation and cover the entire surface of the Earth with paper clips. The End.\n\n\"Projection\" is the mental process by which people attribute to others what is in their own minds. There is a lot of this going on in the debate about AI. When Musk talks about his existential fear of AI, he is not really talking about AI - he is talking about himself. Male billionaires like Musk assume that super intelligent machines would act just like they themselves would act (if they were super intelligent). AI would set out to conquer and dominate everything around itself, unable (perhaps unwilling) to think about the wider consequences of its actions.\n\nThe current debate about AI regulation is stuck in a dichotomy between \"boomers\" and \"doomers\". This is an ideological battle between those eager to hasten the benefits of advanced AI - to help us automate work, accelerate medical diagnoses, mitigate the effects of climate change - and those who worry that the machines will kill us all.\n\nFew experts today believe that AI should be shut down entirely (or that it even can be). Most understand that AI comes with certain risks, particularly around privacy violations, creation of biased decision-making systems, mass surveillance and other forms of social control.\n\nBut when Sunak talks about how to best fight the Terminator he is suggesting that Britain's regulatory efforts are concentrated on a set of capabilities that AI doesn't yet have. This focus on hypothetical harm means fewer enforceable handrails on existing applications. The patriarchal imagination is unable to view AI outside of its own tendency to see all relationships as relationships of domination. AI has to be either a \"servant\" to humanity or a ruthless Terminator-like cyborg master. If AI is just a submissive servant it doesn't need to be regulated and Silicon Valley can be left alone to develop the technology for its own profit. But if AI is a ruthless master in the making it should probably be completely banned or at least severely restricted already.\n\nNeither of these positions are helpful when approaching the complex task of regulating AI. Still, the debate seems unable to move on. And it has to do with the stories we have been told.\n\nLike all of the monsters that societies have created over the millennia, present fears of deadly AI illuminate what really makes us anxious as a society.\n\nVampires embodied our fear of sexuality (and disease). Zombies evoked the chilling image of uncontrollable appetites run amok. What is interesting about our current nightmares around AI is that the robots are not motivated by desire or violence. The AI monsters we imagine are almost always guided by a single abstract principle. The machines don't really intend to kill us. The destruction of the human species is merely an inevitable consequence of a system we created ourselves. The workings of it are based on calculated and indisputable logic. It is completely \"rational\". It just happens to also be completely insane.\n\nThe patriarchal imagination has an inbuilt fear of technology because it views it as inherently violent. The dominant image we have of humanity's development is one of the ape who rose to become a bearded male, grabbed hold of a sharp stick, turned it into a spear and aimed it at his surroundings.\n\nTechnology understood like this becomes inextricably linked with our will to conquer the world. This makes us scared of AI. We fear that the machines will do to us what we have already done to others.\n\nWe assume that technology must have begun with a weapon (and that the first inventor must have been a man). But as the science-fiction writer Ursula Le Guin pointed out, \"the spear\" was probably not the original technology. Archaeologists and anthropologists now increasingly believe that sharpened sticks were invented by women to gather foods, and were adapted for hunting only later. If the first tools weren't hunting tools it isn't clear that technology must always seek to crush, dominate and exploit. Female science-fiction authors have often been criticised for not writing \"hard\" science fiction precisely because they have defined technology in this more neutral sense. As Le Guin put it: \"Technology is just the active human interface with the material world.\" There is nothing inherently violent about it. Unless we want it to be. But the patriarchal imagination doesn't seem to think it will be up to us to decide this.\n\n\"If you build systems that are smarter than humans, well the human era is over. Humans no longer matter,\" a tech investor told the Financial Times.\n\nIt could well be that large language models (such as ChatGPT) are intelligent (and even conscious in some way). But why do people, especially men, take this to mean that machines are going to possess human-like intelligence given the myriad forms of plant and animal intelligent life? Dolphins possess the most sophisticated sonar known to science and plants like the mimosa can learn and remember. Rather than AI being a step on the path to \"human\" intelligence, is it not more likely that it will possess a form entirely of its own?\n\nAI could in this sense be an opportunity to change the way we see our relationship with other life forms on Earth. However, as the science-fiction writer Donna Haraway has pointed out, in most storytelling plants, animals and natural places are mainly \"props, ground, plot space, or prey\". That's how the patriarchal imagination likes them. But this is limiting our ability to understand AI. It makes it difficult for us to compare its \"intelligence\" to any other intelligence but our own. The only potential relationship the patriarchal imagination can see is one of zero-sum competition, and this creates the common fear that AI is coming to \"replace us\".\n\nThere are real economic dangers to this type of reasoning. Headlines such as \"AI could spell the end of human teachers in schools\" risk becoming self-fulfilling. They make continued investment into human teachers less likely and turn this political choice into an inevitability dictated by the forces of technology.\n\nOne of the most misunderstood imaginings about AI is from The Matrix. The film series is often misinterpreted as being about machines enslaving humanity. But the most important machine in the film is The Oracle (portrayed as a wise black woman sitting in a kitchen).\n\nThe Matrix films are about the inability of the machines to separate themselves from their human makers and the need to build a new relationship. When the (human) hero expresses doubt about the capacity of machines to love, he is simply told that perhaps its his own idea of love that is too limited? There is after all a difference between love as a \"human emotion\".\n\nAnd love as a force.\n\nIt is telling how even stories such as The Matrix - from outside of the patriarchal imagination - are distorted and misrepresented by it. It leaves us with the idea of AI as something isolated, potentially violent, separate from nature and obsessed with the will to dominate, compete and exploit. But that is just the patriarchy describing itself, then screaming in fear of its own reflection.\n\nTraditional fantasy and science fiction are often about a virtuous status quo threatened by a dark outsider. The patriarchal imagination embraces and revels in this kind of story because it is about defending the status quo. But as the science-fiction writer NK Jemisin has pointed out: \"As a black woman I have no particular interest in maintaining the status quo.\" Therefore, her stories are different. That's why those written by people who are not the \"status quo\" are so useful when it comes to helping us look at AI as something less threatening. Yes, intelligent machines might change everything. Wouldn't that be just wonderful!\n\nToday we often fail to acknowledge how technology is shaped within our preconceived ideas of the world. Instead, we are encouraged to view it as an unstoppable force pushing everything along. All that is left for us is to \"adapt\" ourselves and our economies to technology. Or maybe \"predict\" where it will take us. We don't have much of a say about the destination.\n\nWe talk as if the machines were the active participants in history, and humanity the passive ones. We dance around the machines as if they were deities. Forgetting that we have created them with our own hands. Fed them with data from our own minds. It is a narrative that leaves us both powerless and without responsibility.

Instead, with a 30-point poll lead, it's parroting Tory soundbites\n\nIf you have ever been bored and on the internet, you may have played a \"who said it?\" quiz, in which you are asked to consider two comically similar orators - say, Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and guess which one really uttered the quote. I find myself playing that game a lot lately, except rather than choosing between similar-sounding celebrities it is the Labour party and the Tories.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the Labour leadership give soundbites that could easily be mistaken for the words of a Conservative minister, most notably when discussing the social security system. In a speech to the centre-left Demos thinktank last week, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, stressed \"a life on benefits\" would not be an option under her party. It is not simply that such a statement is clearly nonsense - if \"a life on benefits\" is even possible, it is less a life of luxury and more one where claimants can't afford toilet roll - but that it is not even original. Kendall's phrasing was almost identical to the words of the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, who, in November, said, \"Benefits shouldn't be there for ever if they're not required.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as the number of people who are out of work long-term continues to rise, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, appears to be aiming not only to mimic her counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, but to outdo him. Asked what she would do differently to the budget last week, Reeves told the BBC that, among other measures: \"We need to get people back to work. There are 700,000 more people due to be on sickness benefits\", as if the problem with the past decade of Conservative rule is that it has been too soft on benefits claimants.\n\nAnyone who is surprised by this has not been paying attention. Each time Keir Starmer has refused to commit to repealing a Tory benefit cut over the past year, his robotic delivery of the dog whistle of being on the side of \"working people\" has given the same message: the grownups are in charge and they can give directions to the local food bank.\n\nIn many ways, this is old ground for the Labour party. When George Osborne framed post-2010 austerity as a means to fix Labour's \"out of control\" benefits bill, the leadership at the time - first Ed Miliband and then interim leader Harriet Harman - adopted the narrative with the air of a sinner looking to repent, culminating in the party abstaining from the vote on the government's toxic welfare bill. In 2015, Reeves - then shadow work and pensions secretary - famously declared Labour was \"not the party of people on benefits\".\n\nSuch capitulation is in part a rational response to a media ecosystem in Britain that enables a small group of rightwing newspapers to shape Labour's policy agenda, painting the party as economically unsound the minute it attempts to make ordinary people's lives slightly better. But it is also a trap of the party's own making. Starmer's narrow emphasis on \"fiscal responsibility\" - and Reeves's unnecessary commitment to the government's flawed fiscal rules - enables the Conservatives to set the agenda and buys into, rather than challenges, established wisdom on the legitimacy of public spending. It is not a coincidence that the spending that is deemed irresponsible is typically for the benefits system or wider welfare state. Tax breaks for a CEO's investment portfolio are prudent, while funding for a disabled person's care worker is wasteful.\n\nWe see this again when Labour parrots the government's economic language. In response to the budget, Starmer declared \"the national credit card is maxed out\" while Reeves opted for the old chestnut, \"There's no magic money tree.\" Adopting such framing is not just economically illiterate, it fences Labour in for how a future government can raise funds and spend them. Before you know it, Reeves is announcing that - now that Hunt has taken her non-dom tax revenue policy - she intends to pay for the NHS and school breakfasts through (wait for it) \"future savings to public spending\". Who needs a wealth tax when you can squeeze councils facing bankruptcy?\n\nPut together, such narratives have very clear implications. They tell us that under a Starmer government, the wealthy will never be asked to pay their fair share in tax. When pushed, it is those with the least - poor, sick and disabled people - who will be expected to give the most.\n\nThere is an argument that Labour will be different once in power, that the attitudes currently on display aren't real values, but rather a sensible caution the party must display in order to be electable. Perhaps. But if Labour cannot find its moral compass when it is almost 30 points ahead in the polls, it hardly will when it is buried under the weight of day-to-day government. That Rishi Sunak has just hinted at further tax cuts for workers paid for by a squeeze on welfare makes it even more pressing for the official opposition to actually present an alternative.\n\nBesides, the narrative that the Labour party carves out now does not exist in a vacuum, the equivalent of chip paper that'll be in the bin the morning after election day. It permeates the political culture, stoking a race to the bottom and encouraging the public's worst instincts while pushing the dial further away from the change that's needed. If you reinforce the fear that disabled and sick people are a burden on the struggling taxpayer, there is less pressure to address real insecurity such as low wages and crumbling services once in office. If you put the responsibility for the gaps in the labour market firmly on the individual now, there will soon be less focus on the structural issues - from long NHS waiting lists to poor housing - that are actually causing them.\n\nWhen the election comes and the Tories are at last ousted, a Labour government will have an unenviable inheritance: a population that is sicker and poorer than a decade ago and a public realm that is in rapid decline. But a nation's health is not defined by its material conditions alone. It is defined by its social fabric: whether each of us is willing to chip in for the good of the collective, and our attitudes towards those who appear different or have less. There is much discussion about how Reeves wants to make Britain attractive for the rich, but perhaps it is time to focus on making it appealing for the poor. In a parallel universe, there is a Labour party that is putting as much effort into courting the votes of benefits claimants as bankers. In the end, some people matter and others don't.", "source":{"uri":"theguardian.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"The Guardian"}, "authors":[{"uri":"frances_ryan@theguardian.com", "name":"Frances Ryan", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/7bd4fe23858d02c3c6b5173d36611e0ffbb58f59\/0_116_3500_2101\/master\/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=b9570562416f99a0b4baa6d81c113325", "eventUri":"eng-9381729", "sentiment":0.2705882352941176, "wgt":447919418, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024159131", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"06:00:33", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T06:00:33Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T05:59:46Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/auto-technology\/tesla-rivals-get-low-marks-for-automated-driving-technology\/108423882", "title":"Tesla, rivals get low marks for automated-driving technology - ET Auto", "body":"Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self Driving technology and nine other assisted-driving systems marketed by major automakers received \"poor\" ratings from the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in a new study released on Tuesday.\n\nThe IIHS, a safety research arm of the insurance industry, also said there is no evidence that Autopilot or other assisted-driving systems have real-world safety benefits, based on crash data.\n\n\"We are able to look at insurance claims data.

Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it doesn't make the car autonomous and requires a \"fully attentive driver\" who can \"take over at any moment\"\n\nSix weeks before the first fatal U.S. accident involving Tesla's Autopilot in 2016, the automaker's president Jon McNeill tried it out in a Model X and emailed feedback to automated-driving chief Sterling Anderson, cc'ing Elon Musk.\n\nThe system performed perfectly, McNeill wrote, with the smoothness of a human driver.\n\n\"I got so comfortable under Autopilot, that I ended up blowing by exits because I was immersed in emails or calls (I know, I know, not a recommended use),\" he wrote in the email dated March 25 that year.\n\nNow McNeill's email, which has not been previously reported, is being used in a new line of legal attack against Tesla over Autopilot.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers in a California wrongful-death lawsuit cited the message in a deposition as they asked a Tesla witness whether the company knew drivers would not watch the road when using its driver-assistance system, according to previously unreported transcripts reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Autopilot system can steer, accelerate and brake by itself on the open road but can't fully replace a human driver, especially in city driving. Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it doesn't make the car autonomous and requires a \"fully attentive driver\" who can \"take over at any moment\".\n\nThe case, set for trial in San Jose the week of March 18, involves a fatal March 2018 crash and follows two previous California trials over Autopilot that Tesla won by arguing the drivers involved had not heeded its instructions to maintain attention while using the system.\n\nThis time, lawyers in the San Jose case have testimony from Tesla witnesses indicating that, before the accident, the automaker never studied how quickly and effectively drivers could take control if Autopilot accidentally steers towards an obstacle, the deposition transcripts show.\n\nOne witness testified that Tesla waited until 2021 to add a system monitoring drivers' attentiveness with cameras - about three years after first considering it. The technology is designed to track a driver's movements and alert them if they fail to focus on the road ahead.\n\nThe case involves a highway accident near San Francisco that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\n\nLawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.\n\nExperts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal.\n\n\"If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,\" he said.\n\nRichard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.\n\nBut if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot. Tesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.\n\nMusk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\n\nMcNeill declined to comment. Anderson did not respond to requests. Both have left Tesla. McNeill is a board member at General Motors and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Anderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.\n\nNEARLY 1,000 CRASHES\n\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use. The agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\nAmid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts. The fix was implemented through a remote software update.\n\nHuang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.\n\nTesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving. \"There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,\" Tesla said in a court filing.\n\nA Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.\n\nTesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves. It disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.\n\nDespite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.\n\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up \"enhanced\" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features. The $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\n\n'READY TO TAKE CONTROL'\n\nIn light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.\n\nThe email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law. The former Tesla president's message, he said, \"corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles\".\n\nHuang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript. Reuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behavior. After a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.\n\n\"Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,\" he said. \"It is not the neophytes.\"\n\nA 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions. Autopilot might make an \"unexpected steering input\" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver \"is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake\".\n\nIn depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any research specifically,\" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.\n\nThe automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.\n\nMcDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.\n\n\"I cannot,\" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.\n\nMonk did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.\n\nLULLED INTO DISTRACTION\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.\n\nThe agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: \"Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.\"\n\nIn his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.\n\nThe Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.\n\nMusk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.\n\n\"The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,\" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman. \"I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.\"\n\nTesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers \"adhere to their continuous driving responsibility\".\n\nThe recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading U.S. product-testing companies. Its road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.\n\n\"Autopilot usually does a good job,\" Funkhouser said. \"It rarely fails, but it does fail.\"\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by David Clarke, Peter Henderson and Brian Thevenot)", "source":{"uri":"zawya.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Zawya.com"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/static.zawya.com\/view\/acePublic\/alias\/contentid\/MTBjYjE0MTItNjVkNy00\/3\/tesla-musk-steering-suspension.jpeg?f=3%3A2", "eventUri":"eng-9386232", "sentiment":-0.03529411764705881, "wgt":447917408, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024120165", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"05:27:49", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T05:27:49Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T05:25:21Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7333333492279053, "url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/check-hilariously-low-effort-website-043210266.html", "title":"Check out the hilariously low-effort website for the Musk Foundation, where billions of Elon Musk's philanthropy money goes", "body":"Set up in 2002, the foundation's website has a very plain looking design that is devoid of graphics.\n\nElon Musk might be best known for his entrepreneurial endeavors, but the man also engages in philanthropy.\n\nIn 2002, the billionaire started his charity platform, the Musk Foundation, with his brother, Kimbal.

Don't get me wrong, I loved Poor Things and I think Emma was sensational in it. But when it comes down to best actress, I think Lily Gladstone's performance will be felt for many more years to come.\n\nNB: I was pretty angry. Like, probably, Emma Stone herself, I was expecting Lily Gladstone to win. They'd won the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild award and it seemed like a lock. Not just because of the opportunity to do something historic (they would have been the first Indigenous person to win an acting Academy Award) and take a huge step forward, but just because they gave the best performance. Of course, that's subjective. And I thought Emma Stone was great in Poor Things and gracious in her win. (There are some showbiz-insidery theories as to why Lily lost here.)\n\nKS: I agree. Sure, Emma was great in a quirky movie that will probably have a cult following in a decade's time but Lily gave us something so substantial, so powerful, and so grounding that it was truly shocking she didn't win. It felt like an even bigger blow to have members of the Osage Nation there to support Lily and the film which ultimately lost every award it was nominated for at the Oscars.\n\nNB: What do you think it would have meant for Lily Gladstone to win?\n\nKS: It's hard to overstate the power of Lily winning the Oscar. The first Native American woman to be nominated for best actress and could've been the first to win. There's been quite a critical view of awards shows recently because of their inability to acknowledge people of colour or balance the gender gap between nominees and winners so it felt like the Oscars had a real moment to award someone for both genuine merit and significance and they decided against it.\n\nNB: After the #OscarsSoWhite reckoning in 2015, the Academy promised to make changes, including a diversity requirement for best picture nominees. And even though things have changed, it can feel like nothing has when something like this happens. To make matters worse, we still have geniuses like Elon Musk calling it a \"woke contest\" and whatever this person is complaining about.\n\nKS: How do you think Lily's loss sits within the long history of problematic portrayals of Native Americans in movies?\n\nNB: Well, I am very much into justice when it comes to movies. I love movies. I love old movies.\n\nKS: You are a lover of movies, yes.\n\nNB: Because I love movies, I've had no choice but to love and appreciate old movies, products of their time, which participated in highly questionable, if not downright criminal, practices when it came to marginalised people. I don't tend to want to persecute the people who made those movies or condemn the movies themselves. I prefer to see things rectified now.\n\nKS: I think that's why I tend to not watch many old movies or look too far back because not only will I feel uncomfortable by some of the representations but because I'm far more interested in how we make movies now and who we allow to tell stories.\n\nNB: That is understandable. Also, because I love movies, I tend to prefer to see that rectification and evolution happen within films of high quality. So, to me, this was a slam dunk. Killers of the Flower Moon was certainly flawed, perhaps fundamentally, in its inability to avoid its own white lens. But I still thought it was a really good movie. And I thought Lily was really good in it. This was the perfect opportunity for \"Hollywood\" to make the right choice. And they blew it.\n\nKS: Exactly. It felt like there was this weight resting on the shoulders of the Academy Awards that had been building up for years -- a weight that might be somewhat lifted when Lily Gladstone won. So for her to lose felt not only anticlimactic but also like a bit of a punch in the gut. It made me think: what else do we have to do as Indigenous people to be recognised for our stories? Especially when we tellthose stories with such power and stoicism.\n\nNB: When I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, I felt that weight you're talking about. I felt it even more acutely when Lily was nominated. It feels silly, but I thought, \"This might help make things right, just a little bit.\" The movie is partially about Hollywood's complicity in how it severely butchered the telling of Indigenous stories. The stage was set!\n\nIt felt like we were going to finally move on from things like the super white Dances with Wolves, which won best picture and director in 1991 (and, to be fair, is seen as a step forward in Indigenous portrayal on film). It felt like we were moving on from the booing of Sacheen Littlefeather at the 1973 Oscars ceremony, where she declined, on Marlon Brando's behalf, to accept the best actor award for his role in The Godfather, citing the \"treatment of American Indians today by the film industry\".\n\nThat treatment includes the practice of red face, \"Cowboys and Indians\", horrendous stereotyping, story after story positioning Native Americans as the enemy of righteous white people.\n\nNB: Sometimes I have to remind myself that this is an awards show where people working in show business give each other prizes. No one's curing cancer.\n\nKS: Unfortunately they do not, although I'm sure they've cured cancer in Barbieland.\n\nNB: Let's hope so. But I do think that movies matter. And the prizes we give them matter -- they assign cultural value.\n\nKS: These are the films that help us make sense of the world around us. They help us navigate our own lives so the awards they win do send a signal of what's worthy and what's not.\n\nNB: Right. So even when they get it \"wrong\", they're still showing us what is important. Granted, it's what's important to an elite group of people within the film industry, but they're the decision-makers. They're part of the community that produces movies. So their choices are hard to dismiss.\n\nKS: Exactly, the powers that be who decide which movies get what awards are the same who greenlight scripts or pump money into productions so if the films that win are from a resoundingly white focal point, it's hard not to see how stories similar to those will be made ad nauseum.\n\nNB: It definitely makes me feel like the reports of the Academy evolving past its traditionally conservative voting habits were greatly exaggerated.\n\nKS: I remember when La La Land won several awards and it shocked me because I didn't think it was that great of a movie. Then when the mishap occurred where it was incorrectly announced it had won best picture over Moonlight, for a brief period I thought, 'How can a movie about two white people dancing be more significant than a story of a Black drug dealer helping to raise a young gay Black kid and navigate his life?' It felt like all the film bros had won before the mistake was corrected and Moonlight was revealed as the true winner. What I guess I'm saying is that Moonlight's significance to the culture, and its place in society, was only really acknowledged because it had won the Oscar.\n\nNB: So where do we go from here?\n\nKS: How does the Academy reckon with the fact that it still won't give awards to Native actors, even when they've undeniably delivered the best performance of the year?\n\nNB: Yeah, this was a blow. A Native American person just gave an enormous performance in an enormous movie and it wasn't enough to win. So it's easy to be left with a feeling of \"What does it take?!\"\n\nAs of 2020, Native American representation in film was 0.3 - 0.5%. In 2021, Indigenous people were calling for change. That makes this loss sting all the more. Also, some sports teams in the US still use stereotypical Native American iconography for their mascots and apparel -- and the conversation around changing them gets really stupid really fast. (Lily actually criticised the Kansas City Chiefs' \"Tomahawk chop\" before they won the Super Bowl.)\n\nKS: Do you think there's any reason to be optimistic?\n\nNB: Well, maybe. First of all, Lily has been everywhere since Killers of the Flower Moon came out. The Oscars may not have given them the top prize, but it was clear what the culture valued. We wanted Lily to win. That's why they were trending on Twitter. That's something.\n\nKS: I do truly hope that this is the beginning of Lily's meteoric rise in Hollywood and she's able to grace the big screen more. Not just with Native stories, because true representation is being able to have Native women and people play roles that aren't defined by their identity.\n\nNB: Absolutely. The Academy got it wrong this time and they'll get it wrong again. But the culture will keep moving forward. There's no other choice.", "source":{"uri":"junkee.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Junkee"}, "authors":[{"uri":"jenna_guillaume@junkee.com", "name":"Jenna Guillaume", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"michelle_rennex@junkee.com", "name":"Michelle Rennex", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"lavender_baj@junkee.com", "name":"Lavender Baj", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/junkee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lily-gladstone-oscars-FB-1200-x-630-px.png", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.4431372549019608, "wgt":447916447, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"2024-03-285919443", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"05:12:08", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T05:12:08Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T04:18:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8588235378265381, "url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/tesla-rivals-get-low-marks-for-automated-driving-technology", "title":"Tesla, rivals get low marks for automated-driving technology", "body":"By comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use.

The Times reported that half of the foundation's donations had links to Musk or his businesses. Set up in 2002, the foundation's website has a very plain looking design that is devoid of graphics.\n\nElon Musk might be best known for his entrepreneurial endeavors, but the man also engages in philanthropy.\n\nIn 2002, the billionaire started his charity platform, the Musk Foundation, with his brother, Kimbal. In 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to the foundation.\n\nBut its website appears to be fairly sparse for an organization endowed with billions of dollars from Musk's fortune.\n\nThe Musk Foundation's website is, essentially, just a white webpage with seven lines of text, with no graphics or videos. The site only lists the various causes the foundation supports, ranging from renewable energy and space exploration to artificial intelligence.\n\nIts relatively plain design differentiates it from the slick webpages of other tech-billionaire-funded platforms, like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe website's simple graphic design doesn't mean Musk isn't sending funds the foundation's way. According to a Bloomberg report in December 2022, the Musk Foundation donated $160 million to nonprofits in 2021, including $55 million to the St Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, The New York Times reported that about half of the Musk Foundation's donations in 2021 and 2022 had links to Musk, his staff, or his businesses.\n\nThe Musk Foundation also regularly falls short of the minimum required donations under tax laws, The Times reported, citing tax filings it had obtained.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":{"uri":"businessinsider.nl", "dataType":"news", "title":"Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/65efc067ce7f1785b2e8b670?format=jpeg", "eventUri":"eng-9382216", "sentiment":0.2627450980392156, "wgt":447915942, "relevance":4}, {"uri":"8024094957", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"05:05:06", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T05:05:06Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T05:03:53Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5960784554481506, "url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/aaa68b96-e1cd-4366-a12d-b79c22a90ab7", "title":"Crypto and 'TradFi': a friendship of convenience", "body":"In case you hadn't heard (or choose to ignore such things), bitcoin is back. The original -- and still biggest -- cryptocurrency surged to a record high of more than $72,000 on Monday, having more than tripled in value in the space of a year. Other crypto tokens, such as ethereum and dogecoin -- beloved by Elon Musk -- have also been rallying, with the estimated value of the market climbing to above $2.7tn for the first time in more than two years.\n\nThe funny thing is, though, that there's a chance you have actually not heard. There's not so much talk about which token is next going \"to da moon\" or so many instances of \"Wen Lambo?\" this time around. Newspapers aren't running stories about how hilariously rich everyone is getting apart from you. Worldwide search traffic for \"bitcoin\" and \"crypto\" has climbed in recent days but it is still only about half the level it was the last time a record was hit in 2021, according to Google Trends.\n\nNo, crypto in 2024 (so far, at least) is a rather more subdued affair. And the reason is that the factors reckoned to be driving rising prices are far from the kind of wild crazes we've seen before, such as the mania for initial coin offerings in 2017 or for non-fungible tokens in 2021.\n\nInstead, there are some rather more prosaic things going on. These are: supply and demand dynamics in the lead-up to the \"halving\" expected in April, when the number of new bitcoins mined every 10 minutes halves to 3.125; the prospect of lower interest rates; and institutional capital flows into the 11 bitcoin-based exchange traded funds approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year.\n\nThe last factor is probably having the most impact. More than $50bn has poured into bitcoin ETFs, according to data from crypto platform The Block, with the one launched by BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, already the firm's third-biggest exchange-traded product and the fastest ETF ever to reach $10bn. Some of the world's biggest banks -- Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America -- are all reportedly lining up to get involved in bitcoin, too. (The painful lessons of the financial crisis, about avoiding high-risk, toxic assets, have been forgotten, it seems.)\n\nThe buyers using these new ETFs are conventional investors who see it as a way of diversifying, rather than true believers. So you might think bitcoiners would be unimpressed by their anarchic cryptocurrency -- whose raison d'\u00eatre is, it seems, to circumvent such middlemen and provide a decentralised, censorship-resistant form of money -- being overtaken by the world of traditional finance. Bitcoin has always been about sticking it to the man, surely, not making rich banker-men richer.\n\nBut you would be wrong. \"The OTC desks are running out of $BTC. This is why we are pumping so hard. Institutional FOMO is starting now, $100k will come very soon,\" posted one much-followed crypto account on X. \"I've become pro-ETF, because\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. anyone who's got some kind of exposure is now incentivised to be Team Bitcoin,\" said Peter McCormack recently on his What Bitcoin Did podcast. \"Let's just say it's good to have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on your side. This is the great thing about bitcoin -- all our incentives align.\"\n\nHe's right, of course: when something is backed only by belief, you want as many believers as you can get. But this does rather give the game away about what motivates people to be on \"Team Bitcoin\".\n\nThe institutional investors entering the market do not believe bitcoin is the future of money, nor that it will revolutionise and overthrow the financial system; these companies are the financial system. They buy bitcoin because they calculate they can eke out extra returns by doing so. Furthermore, Fink is not really Team Bitcoin at all -- he has said he also \"see[s] value\" in an ethereum ETF.\n\nThe reality is that the embrace of crypto by the world of traditional finance, or \"TradFi\", as crypto types like to call it, is just as hypocritical as crypto's embrace of institutional investors. I heard one of the hosts of another bitcoin-focused podcast, the Wolf of All Streets, say recently that \"TradFi is just as degen\" -- a crypto word describing a reckless (and degenerate) gambler -- \"as the crypto community is\" and this, unfortunately, is not wholly unjustified.\n\nWith the advent of bitcoin ETFs, what was once a relatively clear boundary between crypto and conventional finance has been broken down for good. And the world of TradFi has shown the emptiness of its talk of learning the lessons of the financial crisis. It has shown that -- like the world of crypto -- it is really just as greedy as ever.", "source":{"uri":"ft.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Financial Times News"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/__origami\/service\/image\/v2\/images\/raw\/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F8afddc37-0ccc-497e-88bb-ae02feac1561.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https:\/\/www.ft.com\/__assets\/creatives\/x\/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "eventUri":"eng-9385170", "sentiment":0.1843137254901961, "wgt":447915906, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"8024092985", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2024-03-12", "time":"05:04:21", "dateTime":"2024-03-12T05:04:21Z", "dateTimePub":"2024-03-12T05:02:15Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/home\/science\/spacex-station-crew-bound-for-earth\/articleshow\/108421967.cms", "title":"SpaceX station crew bound for Earth - Times of India", "body":"WASHINGTON: Four astronauts left the International Space Station on Monday and were bound for Earth following a more than six month mission.\n\nLed by American astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, NASA's Crew-7 arrived at the research platform last August aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon.\n\nThe same spacecraft undocked on Monday morning, with Andreas Mogensen of Denmark, Satoshi Furukawa of Japan, and Russian cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov also on board.\n\nMoghbeli, who was making her first spaceflight, paid tribute to the post-Cold War international partnership that paved the way for the construction of the ISS in the 1990s.\n\n\"It's an indication of what we can do when we work together,\" she said during a farewell ceremony on Sunday.\n\n\"To think back to when this was just a dream itself, and the people that had the vision, the grit and the courage to pursue this orbiting laboratory in low Earth orbit, I'm really proud to be a part of this.\"\n\nNASA and SpaceX are targeting as soon as 5:35 am Tuesday (0935 GMT) for a splashdown off the Florida coast.\n\nSpace remains a rare area of cooperation between the United States and Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions to reshape the global balance of power.

We have been able to look at vehicles with and without these (systems) and determine there is no reduction in claims as a result of these more advanced systems,\" IIHS President David Harkey told Reuters.\n\nBy comparison, there is evidence that automatic emergency braking systems cut rear-end collisions by 50% and cut incidents of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian by 30%, he said.\n\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have said that a Tesla operating with Autopilot engaged is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average and five times safer than a Tesla without the technology enabled.\n\nFederal regulators are investigating nearly 1,000 accidents in which Tesla's Autopilot was in use. A civil case scheduled to go to trial next week in California will be the latest test of Tesla's strategy of blaming crashes on drivers who fail to heed the EV maker's warnings to pay attention to the road when Autopilot or Full Self Driving technology are engaged.\n\nTesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe IIHS study rated 14 assisted-driving systems from nine automakers against standards it developed. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no formal standards governing advanced-driver assistance systems, or ADAS in industry terminology.\n\n\"There are no federal regulations, nor is there good consistent guidance,\" Harkey said. \"That was our reason for putting these safeguards together.\"\n\nOf the systems IIHS tested, only one earned an acceptable rating: The Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive, offered last year on a small number of Toyota Motor's luxury Lexus LS hybrid sedans.\n\n\"Toyota continuously aims to increase vehicle safety,\" Toyota said in a statement. \"As a part of that effort, Toyota, among other things, considers performance in third-party testing programs like NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and IIHS's Top Safety Pick program.\"\n\nGM's Super Cruise and Nissan's \"ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link\" offered on the 2023-2024 Ariya electric vehicle received \"marginal\" overall ratings.\n\n\"We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,\" Nissan said.\n\nGM said in a statement that Super Cruise \"is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience,\" not as a safety feature.\n\nDifferent assisted-driving systems from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Ford, GM, Hyundai's Genesis brand and Geely's Volvo Cars brand received \"poor\" overall ratings, although all achieved \"good\" scores on certain elements of the IIHS tests, the group said.\n\n\"This new IIHS testing methodology does not assess the performance of the driver assistance systems, instead it focuses on safeguards to prevent misuse,\" Mercedes said in a statement. \"We take the findings of the IIHS partial driving automation safeguard ratings very seriously.\"\n\nAutomakers could boost safety ratings by adopting existing technology for functions such as driver-monitoring or attention warnings that achieved \"good\" scores, Harkey said.\n\nTesla and other automakers are improving the capabilities of their systems, the IIHS said. Tesla revised its Autopilot software following a federal recall agreement, and IIHS will test the updated system, Harkey said.\n\n\"We are certainly going to take in the results of these tests as our cars and these systems continue to evolve,\" BMW spokesman Jay Hanson said on Monday.
