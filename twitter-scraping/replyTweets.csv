My wife and I are attorneys and after years of school, extremely hard work, and dedication to our careers we certainly aren‚Äôt about to pick up and leave our respective firms because, like absolutely every other big city in America, politics, illegal immigration, and crime, are untenable.

Never will we take a knee, or beg forgiveness for transgressions we didn't commit, we owe these people nothing! If Liberals feel the need to seek absolution on their own behalf, so be it, but we will continue to look upon Liberals in America, the source of our beloved country‚Äôs destruction, with abject loathing.

Horrifying video taken by one of her assailants, provided to the court, shows the grotesque lead-up. The intoxicated victim was then callously left on a road to be fatally struck by an oncoming vehicle.

""They finna [sic] rape her"" said one of her assailants while laughing in the video of the attack.

Yet mainstream media has been eerily quiet. One can't help but think this case would make bigger waves if the races were reversed. The muted coverage reeks of lingering societal blindspots.

As the four accused young men plead not guilty, the bombshell video evidence looms large. The LSU community demands justice while mourning Brooks' brutal end. Will the media? Doubt it. Apart from Fox News, I've not seen wall-to-wall coverage of Brooks anywhere else. They covered the initial story last January, and that was that. She was forgotten.

Horrifying video taken by one of her assailants, provided to the court, shows the grotesque lead-up. The intoxicated victim was then callously left on a road to be fatally struck by an oncoming vehicle.

""They finna [sic] rape her"" said one of her assailants while laughing in the video of the attack.

Yet mainstream media has been eerily quiet. One can't help but think this case would make bigger waves if the races were reversed. The muted coverage reeks of lingering societal blindspots.

As the four accused young men plead not guilty, the bombshell video evidence looms large. The LSU community demands justice while mourning Brooks' brutal end. Will the media? Doubt it. Apart from Fox News, I've not seen wall-to-wall coverage of Brooks anywhere else. They covered the initial story last January, and that was that. She was forgotten. 

This vile act exposes an ugly truth - the media doesn't care if the victim is young, White, and female ‚Äì and her alleged assailants are black men. Madison Brooks' death cannot be just another statistic silenced into oblivion.",,en,1397,22545,4509,55396,4761082,1,

üëâ Key Highlights:

üìç Four former Twitter executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, sue Elon Musk over $128 million in severance.

üìç Lawsuit filed in California federal court, challenging Musk's claim of firing them for cause.

üìç Executives deny allegations of gross negligence and willful misconduct made by Musk.

üìç Dispute stems from Musk's acquisition of Twitter, where he initially tried to back out.

üìç Plaintiffs accuse Musk of withholding owed payments and forcing legal action as a tactic.

üìç Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, has not yet responded to the lawsuit.

üëâ Context/Background:

üìç The lawsuit highlights ongoing tensions following Musk's tumultuous takeover of Twitter, spotlighting the complexities of high-profile corporate acquisitions and executive compensations.

üëâ Why This Matters:

üìç This legal battle underscores the challenges and potential fallout from corporate acquisitions, especially those involving high-profile figures and contentious transitions.

üëâ Market Insights:

üìç The lawsuit could have implications for investor sentiment towards Musk's ventures and raise questions about corporate governance and executive accountability in tech companies.

üëâ Expert Statement:

üó®Ô∏è Plaintiffs: ""This is the Musk playbook: to keep the money he owes other people, and force them to sue him.""

üëâ Impact & Recommendations:

Key Details:

üìç SpaceX won a $1.8 billion classified contract with the U.S. government in 2021.

üìç The contract expected to significantly impact SpaceX's revenue mix in coming years.

üìç SpaceX's Starshield program tailored for national-security customers, including a $70 million military award.

üìç Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president, emphasizes strong collaboration with the intelligence community.

üìç Starshield supports secure communications, data capture, and observation for government operations.

üìç Terrence O‚ÄôShaughnessy, a former Air Force general, plays a key role in Starshield.

üìç SpaceX's rapid satellite manufacturing and launch capabilities praised by government agencies.

üìç SpaceX's Starlink network aids Ukrainian communications, with tensions over military use.

Context/Background:

SpaceX's involvement with U.S. national security has evolved from launching satellites to becoming a major contractor, reflecting the strategic importance of space.

Why This Matters:

üëâ SpaceX's deepening relationship with military and intelligence agencies underscores the critical role of private sector innovation in national security.

üëâ The company's capabilities in satellite technology and rapid deployment are reshaping defense and intelligence operations.

Market Insights:

üìä SpaceX's engagement with the U.S. government signifies a growing trend of private space companies contributing to national security, challenging traditional defense contractors.

Expert Statement

üó®Ô∏è Gwynne Shotwell: ""There is very good collaboration between the intelligence community and SpaceX.""

Impact & Recommendations:

üìç SpaceX's advancements could accelerate the shift towards more agile and resilient satellite networks for defense purposes.

üìç Policymakers and defense planners may increasingly look to commercial space firms for rapid, innovative solutions.

For instance:
Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.

Key Details:

üìç Delaware judge rules against Elon Musk's $55 billion compensation package from Tesla, citing it as excessive.

üìç The landmark decision overturns the largest executive pay plan in history, demanding Tesla's board to reconsider.

üìç Musk's net worth faces a significant drop without the compensation, moving him to the third-richest globally.

üìç The ruling follows investor claims of inadequate disclosures and board conflicts in the 2018 compensation approval.

üìç Tesla now tasked with formulating a new compensation strategy for Musk, amidst ongoing legal and financial scrutiny.

Context/Background:

Elon Musk's unprecedented pay package was designed to tie his earnings to Tesla's market value and operational milestones, but has now been invalidated by the court, setting a precedent for executive compensation.

Why This Matters:

üëâ This judicial decision could reshape how executive compensations are structured and approved, impacting corporate governance standards across industries.

Market Insights:

üìä The ruling may influence Tesla's stock performance and investor sentiment, as the company revisits its leadership compensation framework.

Impact & Recommendations:

üìç The outcome may prompt companies to adopt more transparent and equitable compensation practices, aligning executive rewards closely with shareholder interests.

üìç Observers should watch for Tesla's response and any potential ripple effects on executive pay structures in other corporations.

Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History

‚ÄúIf Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion ‚Äî a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations ‚Äî his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.

Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News.

Key Details:

üìç Delaware judge rules against Elon Musk's $55 billion compensation package from Tesla, citing it as excessive.

üìç The landmark decision overturns the largest executive pay plan in history, demanding Tesla's board to reconsider.

üìç Musk's net worth faces a significant drop without the compensation, moving him to the third-richest globally.

üìç The ruling follows investor claims of inadequate disclosures and board conflicts in the 2018 compensation approval.

üìç Tesla now tasked with formulating a new compensation strategy for Musk, amidst ongoing legal and financial scrutiny.

Context/Background:

Elon Musk's unprecedented pay package was designed to tie his earnings to Tesla's market value and operational milestones, but has now been invalidated by the court, setting a precedent for executive compensation.

Why This Matters:

üëâ This judicial decision could reshape how executive compensations are structured and approved, impacting corporate governance standards across industries.

Market Insights:

üìä The ruling may influence Tesla's stock performance and investor sentiment, as the company revisits its leadership compensation framework.

Impact & Recommendations:

üìç The outcome may prompt companies to adopt more transparent and equitable compensation practices, aligning executive rewards closely with shareholder interests.

üìç Observers should watch for Tesla's response and any potential ripple effects on executive pay structures in other corporations.

Oh, dear Wall Street Journal, how do I roast thee? Let me count the ways. Your posts are so bland, they make a bowl of oatmeal seem like a rollercoaster ride. It's like you're trying to make finance and economics as exciting as watching paint dry. Hell no! We won't take this snooze-fest any longer!

And don't even get me started on your headlines. ""Fed Minutes Show Officials Expect Rates to Rise Further"" - well, no kidding, Sherlock! It's like you're trying to make the world's most obvious statements sound like breaking news.

Oh, and let's not forget your attempts at humor. ""Why Did the Chicken Cross the Yield Curve?"" Well, I don't know, but I'm sure you'll find a way to make it as unfunny as possible.

But seriously, @wsj, you need to spice things up a bit. Maybe take a page from my book and add a little humor to your posts. Or, you know, just keep doing what you're doing - it's not like anyone actually reads your articles anyway.",1746275959714521103,en,0,0,1,1,164,,

Here's a big secret about American success no one will be dumb enough to tell you except me: 

Unsuccessful, low IQ people use drugs that make them dumber and less successful.

Smart people often -- but not always -- use drugs to improve their performance, and they think of it that way. This variable alone might have doubled American productivity. Your history books won't mention it.

Any article on the illegal drug topic that misses that distinction is nothing but motivated garbage. For example, legal alcohol (that the writers of this article probably enjoy) is poison, whereas mushrooms and LSD can be closer to performance enhancers over time. Weed can go either way.

I think the BOD of his organizations would be well served to acknowledge his multiple clean drug tests and the fact He IS the brand. Don't try to fix something that isn't broken people..

You won‚Äôt answer this question because you don‚Äôt answer any questions here on X. You just broadcast anointed tabloid, and the narrative you‚Äôve chosen to adhere to for $NWSA, and your misaligned team sport adherence to a political party.

You probably use the excuse that you need to support your families, even while realizing YOU could potentially be destroying the lives of thousands upon thousands of families who are dependent on #Tesla, #SpaceX, and other endeavors that have brought massive innovation to this planet. 

And you‚Äôre doing this all with anonymous tips.

Imagine if our justice system worked this way permanently. Where people, like yourself and your family, are no longer innocent until PROVEN guilty in a court of law. 

(because it is certainly headed in that direction).

I‚Äôll be traveling to Berlin next week as the German Farmers have announced that they will launch a protest ‚Äúlarger than the country has ever seen before‚Äù on Monday, January 8. 

Multiple farmers' associations, the train drivers‚Äô union and the trucking industry have announced they‚Äôll be mobilizing against the federal government's plans to cancel for agricultural diesel, cut vehicle tax exemptions and increase truck tolls and carbon taxes. 

There are also countless calls on social media for a general strike against the federal German government - demanding they step down.

Mark my words: There is no doubt that if all of these sectors hold their ground and do not back down as a result of the establishment‚Äôs usual intimidation tactics, that they have the power to completely paralyze the country and finally demand change.

This wouldn‚Äôt be a turning point just for Germany, but also for the rest of Europe. #nofarmersnofood #Bauernprotest",,en,1526,20836,2075,65979,6098516,,

 We advise the countries that threatened Yemen in their joint statement to seek to stop crimes in Palestine, not to protect their perpetrators, and to address the causes of the problem, not its consequences.

 We stress that our operations only target ships linked to Israel, not with the aim of seizing or sinking them, but rather with the aim of changing their course to increase the cost to Israel as a pressure card to stop its aggression and allow food, medicine and fuel to enter Gaza.

 The claim of the signatory countries to the statement that our naval operations ultimately endanger the movement of food, fuel and vital humanitarian aid around the world reveals the extent of their hypocrisy, because they are the ones preventing food, fuel and humanitarian aid from reaching those besieged in Gaza and the goal of our action is to break its inhumane siege.  .",1742762305077571851,en,0,0,0,0,204,,

 Of course they all have no comment, #Disney #Netflix and #Yale have no comment because that would be like pissing into the ferocious wind of truth.

The puppeteers of what used to be monolithic masterpieces of information like the Wall Street Journal, have become drunk with power, #WMV has become there #WMD. It‚Äôs a story as old as the hills. 

And not at all what this nation is based on. All #MSM has managed to accomplish is to breeding of the likes of Elon Musk and even #DonaldTrump, where the only thing that they really have in common is that you made them, with each accidentally designed, and made for, different levels of intelligence.

The combination of which directly addresses the problem at hand. This is one of the great aspects of America that is still left in tact. Truth rises to the top.

Personally, I‚Äôm not a devoted fan of Trump, but I am of Elon Musk, I voted for Obama, even for Hillary, but what‚Äôs happened lately is enough to change anyone with half a mind.

Like Musk I‚Äôve gone from being a Democrat to an independent. And I am definitely not alone there. 

I worked in the Hollywood entertainment industry for 30 years. Thank God I‚Äôm retired now and don‚Äôt have to worry about being fired or let go for what I just wrote while living in America. 

I was a VFX artist my name is in everything from Matrix to Moana, That used to be an American industry, but we‚Äôve allowed foreign interest to break the World Trade Agreement and move it from our country to theirs with massive government subsidies. Up to 60% if you do VFX for your American project in Vancouver is kicked back to the American studio behind the picture. 

So bye bye to tens of thousands of middle class American jobs.
